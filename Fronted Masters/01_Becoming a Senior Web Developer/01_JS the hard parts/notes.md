<h2>JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2</h2>

<h4>1. JavaScript Principles</h4>

<h6>1.1 Thread of Execution</h6>

When JS code runs it:
Goes through the code line-by line and runs/'executes' each line - known as the `thread of execution`.

Saves 'data' like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in it's `memory`.

<h6>1.2 Function</h6>

Functions:

In JS, a function is a block designed to perform a particular task.

- Function Declaration

```js
function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

## SwiftUI essentials

### Section 1: Create a new project and explore the canvas

Step 1:
Open Xcode and either click "Create New Project" in Xcode's startup windowe, or choose File -> New -> Project.

Step 2:
In the template selector, select iOS as the p;atform, select the Ap ptemplate, and then click Next.

Step 3:
Enter "Landmarks" ase the product name, select "SwiftUI" for the interface and "Swift" for the language, and click NEXT Choose a location to save the Landmarks project on your Mac.

Step 4:
In the Project navigator, select LandmarksApp.

An app that uses the SwiftUI app life cycle has a structure that conforms to the App protocol. The structure's body property returns one or more scenes, which in turn provide content for display.
The @main attribute identifies the app's entry point.

Step 5:
In the Project navigator, select ContentView.

By default, SwiftUI view files declare a structure and a preview. The structure conforms to the View protocol and describes the view's content and layout. The preview declaration creates a preview for that view.

Step 6:
The canvas displays a preview automatically.

If the canvas isn't visible, select Editor > Canvas to show it.

<h6>1.1.3 Breakthrough of Node.js</h6>

<h6>1.1.4 Node.js Conquers Windows</h6>

<h6>1.1.5 io.js: The fork of Node.js</h6>

In 2014 the communiny was unhappy with how things were running and that led to `io.js` developed separately from the original platform.

The technical steering committee (TSC) is responsible for further developing the platform.

<h6>1.2.2 Collaborators</h6>

Collaborators are designated by the TSC.

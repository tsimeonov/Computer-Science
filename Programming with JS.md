# Week 1 

## Setting up 

### Introduction to Programming with JS
JS is used for both front and back-end development, and the creation of mobile applications.

## Welcome to Programming

### Introduction to programming
- Computer program - A series of instructions that tell a computer what todo in specific curcumstances.
- Programming language - A bridge that facilitates communication between computers and people.
- Low level languages - Closer to being understood by a computer's CPU.
- High level languages - Languages that must be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with them.

### Why JavaScript?
- JS is a language used to build interactivity into web pages.
- Direct interaction - JS allows direct interaction with webpages dynamically on the client.

### Programming in JS 

### Variables

### Data Types 
Primitive data types
1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Null - The absence of value
5. Undefined - A variable not yet assigned a value
6. BigInt - A data type that accommodated a greater range of numbers.
7. Symbol - A data type used as a unique identifier.

Non-Primitive data types 
1. Objects 
2. Array
3. Functions

### Operators 
- Assignment operator = 
```javascript
let person = 'Jim'
```
- Arithmetic Operators

| Operator   | Meaning        | Example  |
| -----------|:-------------: | -----:|
| +          | Addition       | 2 + 3 |
| -          | Substraction   | 3 - 2 |
| /          | Division       | 35 / 5 |
| *          | Multiplication | 7 * 4 |

- Comparison Operators

| Operator   | Meaning        | Example  |
| -----------|:-------------: | -----:|
| >          | Greater than   | 3 > 2 |
| <          | Less than      | 2 < 3 |
| ==          | Equal to      | 5 == 5 |
| !=          | Not equal to  | 5 ! 6 |

- Comparison Operators

| Operator   | Meaning        | Example  |
| -----------|:-------------: | -----:|
| >          | Greater than   | 3 > 2 |
| <          | Less than      | 2 < 3 |
| ==          | Equal to      | 5 == 5 |
| !=          | Not equal to  | 5 ! 6 |

- Logiacal Operators

| Operator   | Meaning        | Example  |
| -----------|:-------------: | -----:|
| &&          | Checks for both conditions to be true   | a > 5 && a < 10 |
| &#x7c;&#x7c;          | Checks for at least one condition to be true      | a > 5 &#x7c;&#x7c; a > 10 |
| !          | Returns false if the result is true      | !(a > 5) |

### Number data type
Foundational data type that represents integers and decimal points.

### Strings
A collection of characters ecnclosed in single quotes or double quotes.

## Conditions and Loops 

### Writing statements
- If Statement
```javascript
if (condition == true) {
  // Execute code
}
```
- If-else statement
```javascript
if (condition == true) {
  // Execute code
} else {
  // Execute code
}
```
- Else-if statement
- Switch statement

### Looping constructs

- For loop
- While loop
- Nested loops

## Arrays, Objects and Functions

### Functions

### Storing data in arrays

Array literal syntax `[]`
```javascript 
  let train1 = ['wheat', 'barley', 'potato', 'salt', 'rocks']
  console.log(train[0]) // Output: wheat
```

Notice that there are three types of symbols in the flowchart: ovals, parallelograms and rectangles. The ovals, which appear at the top and botoom of the flowchart, are called `terminal symbols`. The `Start terminal` symbol marks the program's starting point and the `End terminal` symbol marks the program's ending point.
Between the terminal symbols are parallelograms, which are used for both `input symbols` and `output symbols`, and rectangles, which ar called `processing symbols`.

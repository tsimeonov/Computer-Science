## Working with Reference Types
### Difference between Primitive Data Types and Reference Types
Primitive data types include:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol (added in ECMAScript 6)
The primitive data types are stored in the memory, and they have fixed size.

Reference data types:
- Ojects
- Arrays
- Dates
- Regular Expressions
- Custom objects
Reference types are not stored directly in the memory, but instead, a reference to the value is stored in the memory (this is referred to as a pointer).

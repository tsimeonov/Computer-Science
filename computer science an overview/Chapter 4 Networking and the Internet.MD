# 4.1 Network Fundamentals
## 4.1.1 Network Classifications
A computer network is often classified as being either a: 
- `Personal area network` (PAN)
- `Local area network` (LAN)
- `Metropolian area network` (MAN)
- `Wide area network` (WAN)
## 4.1.2 Protocols
For a network to function, it is important to establishh tules by wich activities are conducted. Such rules are called `protocols`
## 4.1.2 Combining Networks
Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.
## 4.1.3 Methos of Process Communication
- Clien/server model
- Peer to peer model
# 4.2 The Internet
The internet connects devices and networks all ove rthe world. <br>
Nettworks and infrastructure are supported by both commercial and goverment initiatives.
## 4.2.1 Internet Architecture
As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks. In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called `Internet Service Providers (ISPs)`. <br>
The internet and the systems built on it are hierarchical and redundant. <br>
Hierarchy and redundanct hekp systems scale.
## 4.2.2 Internet Addressing
IP addresses are hierarchical. <br>
Connecting devices to the Internet is enabled by assignement of an Internet protocol (IP) address. <br>
The domain name system (DNS) translates domain names to IP addresses.
Hierarchy in the DNS helps that system scale.
## 4.2.3 Internet Applications
In the earlier days of the internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol. A newsreader application contracted servers using the `Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)`, an application fol listing and copying files across the network implementedthe `File Transfer Ptotocol (FTP)`, or an application for accessing anotehr computer from a great distance used the `Telnet` protocol, or later the `Secure Shell (SSH)` protocol. As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more adn more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages vi tbe powerful `Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)`
## 4.2.3 Electronic Mail
`SMTP (Simple mail Transfer Protocol)` defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.
## 4.2.4 VoIP
`VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)` 
## 4.2.5 Internet Multimedia Streaming
# 4.3 The World Wide Web
## 4.3.1 Web Implementation
Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: `browsers` amd `webservers`. <br>
In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a `Uniform Resource Locator (URL)`.
## 4.3.2 HTML 
`Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)`
## 4.3.3 XML 
`eXtensible Markup Language (XML)`
## Client-Side and Server-Side Activities
# 4.4 Internet Protocols
## 4.4.1 The Layered Approach to Internet Software
The internet software layers are knows as the `application layer`, the `transportation layer`, the `network layer` and the `link layer`. <br>
The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data issent by breaking the dat into blocks of bits called packets, whicj contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.
## 4.4.2 The TCP/IP Protocol Suite
The TCP/IP protocol suite is a collection of protocols that provide the foundation for communication in the internet. It stands for `Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol`. The TCP/IP protocol suite consists of  several protocols that work tohether to enable reliable and efficient communication between devices connected to a network.

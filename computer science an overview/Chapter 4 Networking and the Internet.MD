# 4.1 Network Fundamentals
## 4.1.1 Network Classifications
A computer network is often classified as being either a: 
- `Personal area network` (PAN)
- `Local area network` (LAN)
- `Metropolian area network` (MAN)
- `Wide area network` (WAN)
## 4.1.2 Protocols
For a network to function, it is important to establishh tules by wich activities are conducted. Such rules are called `protocols`
## 4.1.2 Combining Networks
Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.
## 4.1.3 Methos of Process Communication
- Clien/server model
- Peer to peer model
# 4.2 The Internet
The internet connects devices and networks all ove rthe world. <br>
Nettworks and infrastructure are supported by both commercial and goverment initiatives.
## 4.2.1 Internet Architecture
As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks. In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called `Internet Service Providers (ISPs)`. <br>
The internet and the systems built on it are hierarchical and redundant. <br>
Hierarchy and redundanct hekp systems scale.
## 4.2.2 Internet Addressing
IP addresses are hierarchical. <br>
Connecting devices to the Internet is enabled by assignement of an Internet protocol (IP) address. <br>
The domain name system (DNS) translates domain names to IP addresses.
Hierarchy in the DNS helps that system scale.
## 4.2.3 Internet Applications
In the earlier days of the internet, most applications were separate, simple programs that each followed a network protocol. A newsreader application contracted servers using the `Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)`, an application fol listing and copying files across the network implementedthe `File Transfer Ptotocol (FTP)`, or an application for accessing anotehr computer from a great distance used the `Telnet` protocol, or later the `Secure Shell (SSH)` protocol. As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more adn more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages vi tbe powerful `Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)`
## 4.2.3 Electronic Mail
`SMTP (Simple mail Transfer Protocol)` defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.

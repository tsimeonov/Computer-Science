# 2.1 Computer Architecture
The circuitry in a computer that controls the manipulation of data is called 'central processing unit', or 'CPU' (often referred to as merely the processor).

## CPU Basics
A CPU consists of three parts: the `arithmetic/logic unit`, which contains the circuitry that performs operations on data (such as addition and substraction); the `control unit`, which contains the circuitry for coordinatiing the machine's activities; and the `register unit`, which contains data storage cells (similar to main memory cells), called `registers`, that are used for temporary storage of information within the CPU.

Some of the registers within the register unit are considered `general-purpose registeres` whereas others are `special-purpose registers`. <br>
General purpose registers serve as temporary holding places for data being manipulated by the CPU. <br>
For the purpose of transfering bit patterns, a machine's CPU and main memory are connected by a collection of wires or traces called a `bus`.

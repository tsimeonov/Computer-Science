### Proof techniques - part 1

#### Lesson 2.0 Introduction

What is proof?

In discrete mathematics, a proof is a logical argument that demonstrates the truth of a mathematical statement using a series of deductive steps based on axioms, definitions, and previously established results.

#### Lesson 2.2 Formal Proof

Direct Proof

- Easy because no particular technique is used
- Not easy - starting point in not obvious 
- Know your definitions
- Allowed to use any theorem (e.g axiom, logic)

Theorem: If n and m are both even, then n + m is even

- **Proof**: What does *even* mean?
- If an integer is **even**, it can be made by **twice another integer**
- Let n = 2k, m = 2l, where *k* and *l* are integers
- Then:  
  m + n = 2k + 2l
- Factorise:  m + n = 2(k + l)
- Integers are closed under addition
- k + l is an integer, call it *t*
- m + n = 2t. So, it is even

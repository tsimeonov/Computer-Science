### Lesson 1.3: First order logic

Propositional Equivalences

- Formula A and B are `equivalent` if they have the sme truth tables
- We denote the equivalence by `≡`
- `A ≡ B` means that A and B always have the same truth values regardless of how the variables are assigned
- Note that `≡` is not a connective

De Morgan's laws

De Morgan’s Laws describe how negation interacts with conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨).
They are fundamental in propositional logic, Boolean algebra, and digital circuit design.

The Two Laws:

¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ ¬Q)

"Not (P and Q)" is equivalent to "Not P or Not Q"

¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ (¬P ∧ ¬Q)

"Not (P or Q)" is equivalent to "Not P and Not Q"

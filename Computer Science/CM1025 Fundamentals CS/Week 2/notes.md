### Lesson 1.3: First order logic

Propositional Equivalences

- Formula A and B are `equivalent` if they have the sme truth tables
- We denote the equivalence by `≡`
- `A ≡ B` means that A and B always have the same truth values regardless of how the variables are assigned
- Note that `≡` is not a connective

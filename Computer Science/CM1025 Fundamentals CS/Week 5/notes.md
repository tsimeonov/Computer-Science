#### `Counting`

<details>
  <summary>The product rule</summary>
  
- Suppose there is a job with two tasks
    - There are `n` ways of completing the first task
    - There are `m` ways of completing the second task
- Then there are `m*n` ways of completing this job 
- How many ways can you pick an outfit? If you have 5 pairs of trousers and 7 shirts

5 \* 7 = 35

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What if you have 5 shirts, 3 pairs of trousers and 2 pairs of shoes?</summary>

- We can first consider 5 shirts and 3 pairs of trousers
- Using the product rule, there are `5 * 3 = 15` ways to pick an outfit
- Now, consider these `15 ways` and `two pairs of shoes`
- Again, based on the product rule, there are ` `

<details>
  <summary>Product rule for more tasks</summary>

- Suppose there is a job with `k` tasks
- If there are $n_i$ ways to completing task `i`
- Then there are $n_i * n_2 ... n_k$ ways of completing this job
- What if you have `5` shirts, `3` pairs of trousers and `2` pairs of shoes?
- There are 5 _ 3 _ 2 = 30 ways of schoosing an outfit

  <summary>Example</summary>

- How many sequences of 5 letters can yuo make using the english alphabet?

$25^5$ = 11881376

</details>

<details>
  <summary>The Sum Rule</summary>

- If a job can be done either in `n` ways OR in `m` ways, then the job can be
  completed in `m+n` ways.

- So, if you have `5` pairs of trousers and `7` shirts, we have (5+7) = 12 ways of
  choosing an item from them.

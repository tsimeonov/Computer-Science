### Lesson 1.1 Propositional Logic

`Propositional logic` (also known as sentential logic or statement logic) is a brach of logic that deals with `propositions` - statements that are either `true` or `false`, but not both.

`Basic Concepts`:

- A proposition is a declarative sentence like:
  - "It's raining" -> Can be true or false
  - "2 + 2 = 5" -> Clearly is false, but still a proposition

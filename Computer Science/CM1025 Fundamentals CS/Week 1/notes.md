### Lesson 1.1 Propositional Logic

`Propositional logic` (also known as sentential logic or statement logic) is a brach of logic that deals with `propositions` - statements that are either `true` or `false`, but not both.

`Basic Concepts`:

- A proposition is a declarative sentence like:

  - "It's raining" -> Can be true or false
  - "2 + 2 = 5" -> Clearly is false, but still a proposition

- `Logical connectives` are used to build more complex propositions:

  - ¬ (not): Negation

  - ∧ (and): Conjunction

  - ∨ (or): Disjunction

  - → (if... then): Implication

  - ↔ (if and only if): Biconditional

`What is a proposition?`

- Questions
  - Cannot be assigned a truth value
- Imperatives (essential or urgent thing)
  - Does not take a truth value
- Sentences dependent on variables
  - The truth value changes with the variable

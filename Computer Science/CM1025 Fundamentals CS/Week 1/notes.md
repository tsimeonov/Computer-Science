### Lesson 1.1 Propositional Logic

`Propositional logic` (also known as sentential logic or statement logic) is a brach of logic that deals with `propositions` - statements that are either `true` or `false`, but not both.

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false, but not both.

---

`Basic Concepts`:

- A proposition is a declarative sentence like:

  - "It's raining" -> Can be true or false
  - "2 + 2 = 5" -> Clearly is false, but still a proposition

- `Logical connectives` are used to build more complex propositions:

  - Â¬ (not): Negation

  - âˆ§ (and): Conjunction

  - âˆ¨ (or): Disjunction

  - â†’ (if... then): Implication

  - â†” (if and only if): Bi-conditional

---

`What is a proposition?`

- Questions
  - Cannot be assigned a truth value
- Imperatives (essential or urgent thing)
  - Does not take a truth value
- Sentences dependent on variables
  - The truth value changes with the variable

---

`Examples:`

Example A:

P = I study 20 hrs a week
S = I will be happy
R = I will pass the exam
Q = I attend all the lectures

- (P v Q) -> (R ^ S)
- (P or Q) -> (R ^ S)
- (P or Q) -> (R and S)
- If (P or Q) then (R and S)
- If "_I study 20 hrs a week_" or "_I attend all the lectures_", then "_I will pass the exam_" and "_I will be happy_"

Example B:

If the UK down not leave the EU, then skill nurses will not leave the NHS and research grants will remain intact.

- Let's name the atomic propositions:
  - P = UK leaves the EU,
  - Q = Nurses leave NHS,
  - S = Research grants will remain intact
- Rewrite:
  - **if** (not P) **then** (not Q and S)
- Connectives:
  - **if** (not P) **then** (not Q and S)
  - **not** P -> (**not** Q and S)
  - Â¬P -> (Â¬Q **and** S)

**Truth tables**:

|  P  |  Q  | Â¬P  | P âˆ§ Q | P âˆ¨ Q | P â†’ Q | P â†” Q |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  T  |  T  |  F  |   T   |   T   |   T   |   T   |
|  T  |  F  |  F  |   F   |   T   |   F   |   F   |
|  F  |  T  |  T  |   F   |   T   |   T   |   F   |
|  F  |  F  |  T  |   F   |   F   |   T   |   T   |

ðŸ“˜ Explanation of Columns:

- Â¬P: True when P is false

- P âˆ§ Q: True only when both P and Q are true

- P âˆ¨ Q: True if at least one of P or Q is true

- P â†’ Q: False only when P is true and Q is false (i.e., a broken promise!)

- P â†” Q: True when P and Q have the same truth value

---

### Lesson 1.2 Tautology

A **tautology** is a single statement (or proposition) that is always true, no matter what truth values its components have.

Example:

- P v Â¬P ("P or not P") -> Always true, no matter if P is true or false.

Key ideas:

- Tautology = Universal true statement
- It's like logical "no-brainer" true by its form

A `consistency` applies to set of statements. A set is consistent if there is at least one way (one truth assignment) in which all the statements can be true at the same time.

Example:

Set:

- P â†’ Q

- P

- Q

This set is consistent because it's possible for all 3 to be true at once (if both P and Q are true).

But this set would be inconsistent:

- P

- Â¬P

Because P and not P canâ€™t be true at the same time.

Key Idea:

- Consistency = All statements can be true together
- Inconsistency = Contradiction somewhere

### Lesson 1.2 Tautology

---

- `Tautology` - a formula that is `always true`
- Example: p âˆ¨ Â¬ p // "_p or not p_"
  - (pâˆ§q) -> p // "_If p and q are true, then p is true_"
  - (pâˆ§q) -> q // "_If p and q are true, then q is true_"
- Not a tautology
  - pâˆ§q
  - Because if T(p) = 0 then pâˆ§q is false
    "T(p) // _Truth value of p_"
  - p->q // "_p then q_"
  - Because if T(p) = 1 and T(q) then p->q is false

---

- `Consistent` - a formula that is `true at least for one` scenario
- Example pâˆ§q // "_p and q_"
- All the connectives are consistent
- Not consistent or inconsistent is a formula that is never true
- p âˆ§ Â¬ p // "_p and not p_"
- (p âˆ¨ Â¬ p) -> (p âˆ§ Â¬ p) // "_p or not p then p and not p_"
- It's also called `Contradiction`

---

(Â¬ p âˆ§ q) âŸº (p âˆ¨ Â¬ q) // "_not p and q if and only if p or not q_"

|   p   |   q   |  Â¬p   |  Â¬q   | Â¬p âˆ§ q | p âˆ¨ Â¬q | (Â¬p âˆ§ q) âŸº (p âˆ¨ Â¬q) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: | :-----------------: |
| false | false | true  | true  | false  |  true  |        false        |
| false | true  | true  | false |  true  | false  |        false        |
| true  | false | false | true  | false  |  true  |        false        |
| true  | true  | false | false | false  |  true  |        false        |

Tautology and Contradiction

- Tautology: A formula that is `always true`

  - Example: p âˆ¨ Â¬ p // "_p or not p_"
  - The same as p âˆ¨ Â¬ p â‰¡ True

- Contradiction: is a formula that is `always false`
  - Example: p âˆ§ Â¬ p // "_p and not p_"
  - The same as p âˆ§ Â¬ p â‰¡ False

---

Tautology? Consistent? Contradiction?

Example 1:

- (p âˆ¨ Â¬p) âŸº (p âˆ§ Â¬p) // "_p or not p OR p and npt p_"
  - p âˆ¨ Â¬ p â‰¡ True
  - p âˆ§ Â¬ p â‰¡ False

(p âˆ¨ Â¬p) âŸº (p âˆ§ Â¬p) â‰¡ True âˆ¨ False â‰¡ `True`

Example 2:

- (p -> p) âˆ¨ (q âˆ§ r)
  - p -> p â‰¡ `True`
  - q âˆ§ r â‰¡ consistent
  - `True` âˆ¨ â‰¡ consistent â‰¡ `True`
- So, (p -> p) âˆ¨ (q âˆ§ r) `is a tautology`

---

Some useful relations?

- Tautology âˆ¨ consistent â‰¡ Tautology
- Tautology âˆ§ consistent â‰¡ consistent
- Tautology âˆ¨ contradiction â‰¡ Tautology
- Tautology âˆ¨ contradiction â‰¡ contradiction
- Contradiction âˆ§ consistent â‰¡ Tautology
- Contradiction âˆ¨ consistent â‰¡ contradiction
- Tautology âˆ§ contradiction â‰¡ contradiction
- Contradiction -> Tautology â‰¡ Tautology
- Contradiction -> consistent â‰¡ Tautology

Tautology and consistency - examples
(without using truth tables)

Example 1:

- p -> (q âˆ¨ (p âˆ§ Â¬p))
- p -> (q âˆ¨ False)
- p -> q

`It's consistent`

Example 2:

- (q âˆ§ (p âˆ¨ Â¬p)) -> q
- (q âˆ§ True) -> q
- q -> q

`It's tautology`

Example 3:

- (q âˆ§ (p âˆ§ Â¬p)) -> [(q âˆ§ Â¬q) -> (Â¬p âˆ§ p)]
- (q âˆ§ (p âˆ§ Â¬p)) -> [(q âˆ§ Â¬q) -> False]
- (q âˆ§ (p âˆ§ Â¬p)) -> [False -> False]
- (q âˆ§ (p âˆ§ Â¬p)) -> True
- (q âˆ§ False) -> True
- False -> True

`It's tautology`

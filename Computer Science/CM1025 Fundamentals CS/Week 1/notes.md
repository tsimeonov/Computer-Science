### Lesson 1.1 Propositional Logic

`Propositional logic` (also known as sentential logic or statement logic) is a brach of logic that deals with `propositions` - statements that are either `true` or `false`, but not both.

`Basic Concepts`:

- A proposition is a declarative sentence like:

  - "It's raining" -> Can be true or false
  - "2 + 2 = 5" -> Clearly is false, but still a proposition

- `Logical connectives` are used to build more complex propositions:

  - ¬ (not): Negation

  - ∧ (and): Conjunction

  - ∨ (or): Disjunction

  - → (if... then): Implication

  - ↔ (if and only if): Bi-conditional

`What is a proposition?`

- Questions
  - Cannot be assigned a truth value
- Imperatives (essential or urgent thing)
  - Does not take a truth value
- Sentences dependent on variables
  - The truth value changes with the variable

`Examples:`

P = I study 20 hrs a week
S = I will be happy
R = I will pass the exam
Q = I attend all the lectures

- (P v Q) -> (R ^ S)
- (P or Q) -> (R ^ S)
- (P or Q) -> (R and S)
- If (P or Q) then (R and S)
- If "_I study 20 hrs a week_" or "_I attend all the lectures_", then "_I will pass the exam_" and "_I will be happy_"

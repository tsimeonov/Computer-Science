### 1.1 Propositional Logic

---
`Definition 1`

Let p be a proposition. The negation of p, denoted by ¬p (also denoted by p), is the statement
“It is not the case that p.”
The proposition¬p is read “not p.” The truth value of the negation of p,
of the truth value of p.

|T|F|
|F|T|

`Definition 2`

Let *p* and *q* be propositions. The *conjunction* of *p* and *q*, denoted by *p ∧ q*, is the proposition  
**"p and q."** The conjunction *p ∧ q* is true when both *p* and *q* are true and is false otherwise.

**Definition 3**

Let *p* and *q* be propositions. The *disjunction* of *p* and *q*, denoted by *p ∨ q*, is the proposition  
**"p or q."** The disjunction *p ∨ q* is false when both *p* and *q* are false and is true otherwise.

| p | q | p ∧ q |

| T | T | T      |
| T | F | F      |
| F | T | F      |
| F | F | F      |

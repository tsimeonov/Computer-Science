### 1.1 Propositional Logic

---
`Definition 1`

Let p be a proposition. The negation of p, denoted by ¬p (also denoted by p), is the statement
“It is not the case that p.”
The proposition¬p is read “not p.” The truth value of the negation of p,
of the truth value of p.

`Definition 2`

Let *p* and *q* be propositions. The *conjunction* of *p* and *q*, denoted by *p ∧ q*, is the proposition  
**"p and q."** The conjunction *p ∧ q* is true when both *p* and *q* are true and is false otherwise.

---

**Definition 3**

Let *p* and *q* be propositions. The *disjunction* of *p* and *q*, denoted by *p ∨ q*, is the proposition  
**"p or q."** The disjunction *p ∨ q* is false when both *p* and *q* are false and is true otherwise.

| p | q | p ∧ q |
|:---:|:---:|:--------:|
| T | T | T      |
| T | F | F      |
| F | T | F      |
| F | F | F      |

| F | F | F      |

`Definition 4`

Let *p* and *q* be propositions. The *exclusive or* of *p* and *q*, denoted by *p ⊕ q* (or *p XOR q*),  
is the proposition that is true when exactly one of *p* and *q* is true and is false otherwise.

| p | q | p ⊕ q |
|:---:|:---:|:--------:|
| T | T | F      |
| T | F | T      |
| F | T | T      |
| F | F | F      |

`Definition 5`

Let *p* and *q* be propositions. The *conditional statement* *p → q* is the proposition  
**“if p, then q.”** The conditional statement *p → q* is false when *p* is true and *q* is false, and true otherwise.  
In the conditional statement *p → q*, *p* is called the *hypothesis* (or *antecedent* or *premise*)  
and *q* is called the *conclusion* (or *consequence*).

| p | q | p → q |
|:---:|:---:|:--------:|
| T | T | T      |
| T | F | F      |
| F | T | T      |
| F | F | T      |

`Definition 6`

Let *p* and *q* be propositions. The *biconditional statement* *p ⇔ q* is the proposition  
**“p if and only if q.”** The biconditional statement *p ⇔ q* is true when *p* and *q* have the same truth values,  
and is false otherwise. Biconditional statements are also called *bi-implications*.

| p | q | p ⇔ q |

| T | T | T      |
| T | F | F      |
| F | T | F      |

### 1.1 Propositional Logic

---

`Definition 1`

Let p be a proposition. The negation of p, denoted by ¬¨p (also denoted by p), is the statement
‚ÄúIt is not the case that p.‚Äù
The proposition¬¨p is read ‚Äúnot p.‚Äù The truth value of the negation of p,
of the truth value of p.

|  p  | ¬¨p  |
| :-: | :-: |
|  T  |  F  |
|  F  |  T  |

`Definition 2`

Let _p_ and _q_ be propositions. The _conjunction_ of _p_ and _q_, denoted by _p ‚àß q_, is the proposition  
**"p and q."** The conjunction _p ‚àß q_ is true when both _p_ and _q_ are true and is false otherwise.

---

**Definition 3**

Let _p_ and _q_ be propositions. The _disjunction_ of _p_ and _q_, denoted by _p ‚à® q_, is the proposition  
**"p or q."** The disjunction _p ‚à® q_ is false when both _p_ and _q_ are false and is true otherwise.

|  p  |  q  | p ‚àß q |
| :-: | :-: | :---: |
|  T  |  T  |   T   |
|  T  |  F  |   F   |
|  F  |  T  |   F   |
|  F  |  F  |   F   |

`Definition 4`

Let _p_ and _q_ be propositions. The _exclusive or_ of _p_ and _q_, denoted by _p ‚äï q_ (or _p XOR q_),  
is the proposition that is true when exactly one of _p_ and _q_ is true and is false otherwise.

|  p  |  q  | p ‚äï q |
| :-: | :-: | :---: |
|  T  |  T  |   F   |
|  T  |  F  |   T   |
|  F  |  T  |   T   |
|  F  |  F  |   F   |

`Definition 5`

Let _p_ and _q_ be propositions. The _conditional statement_ _p ‚Üí q_ is the proposition  
**‚Äúif p, then q.‚Äù** The conditional statement _p ‚Üí q_ is false when _p_ is true and _q_ is false, and true otherwise.  
In the conditional statement _p ‚Üí q_, _p_ is called the _hypothesis_ (or _antecedent_ or _premise_)  
and _q_ is called the _conclusion_ (or _consequence_).

|  p  |  q  | p ‚Üí q |
| :-: | :-: | :---: |
|  T  |  T  |   T   |
|  T  |  F  |   F   |
|  F  |  T  |   T   |
|  F  |  F  |   T   |

`Definition 6`

Let _p_ and _q_ be propositions. The _biconditional statement_ _p ‚áî q_ is the proposition  
**‚Äúp if and only if q.‚Äù** The biconditional statement _p ‚áî q_ is true when _p_ and _q_ have the same truth values,  
and is false otherwise. Biconditional statements are also called _bi-implications_.

|  p  |  q  | p ‚áî q |
| :-: | :-: | :---: |
|  T  |  T  |   T   |
|  T  |  F  |   F   |
|  F  |  T  |   F   |
|  F  |  F  |   T   |

`Definition 7`

A _bit string_ is a sequence of zero or more bits. The _length_ of this string is the number of bits in the string.

Example 15

`101010011` is a bit string of length nine.

`Inclusive OR (Logical OR / Disjunction)`

Definition:

A or B is true if either A is true, B is true, or both are true.

Symbol: A ‚à® B (logical OR)

Truth Table:

|   A   |   B   | A ‚à® B |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| True  | True  | True  |
| True  | False | True  |
| False | True  | True  |
| False | False | False |

---

`Exclusive OR (XOR)`

Definition:

A xor B is true only if A or B is true, but not both.

Symbol: A ‚äï B or XOR

Truth Table:

|   A   |   B   | A ‚äï B |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| True  | True  | False |
| True  | False | True  |
| False | True  | True  |
| False | False | False |

---

`Converse`

Definition: Swap the hypothesis and conclusion.

- Original: p ‚Üí q

- Converse: q ‚Üí p

- Example:

Original: If it rains (p), then the ground gets wet (q).

Converse: If the ground gets wet (q), then it rains (p).

üîç Not always true.

---

`Inverse`

Definition: Negate both the hypothesis and conclusion.

- Original: p ‚Üí q

- Inverse: ¬¨p ‚Üí ¬¨q

Example:

Original: If it rains (p), then the ground gets wet (q).

Inverse: If it does not rain (¬¨p), then the ground does not get wet (¬¨q).

üîç Not always true.

---

`Contrapositive`

Definition: Swap and negate both the hypothesis and conclusion.

- Original: p ‚Üí q

- Contrapositive: ¬¨q ‚Üí ¬¨p

Example:

Original: If it rains (p), then the ground gets wet (q).

Contrapositive: If the ground does not get wet (¬¨q), then it did not rain (¬¨p).

‚úÖ Always logically equivalent to the original.

### 1.3 Propositional Equivalences

<details>
  <summary>Definition 1</summary>
  
A compound proposition that is always true, no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it, is called a `tautology`.

A compound proposition that is always false is called a `contradiction`.

A compound proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called a `contingency`.

|  p  | ¬¨p  | p ‚à® ¬¨p | p ‚àß ¬¨p |
| :-: | :-: | :----: | :----: |
|  T  |  F  |   T    |   F    |
|  F  |  T  |   T    |   F    |

  <summary>Definition 2</summary>

The compound propositions p and q are called logically equivalent if p ‚Üî q is a `tautology`.

The notation p ‚â° q denotes that p and q are `logically equivalent`.

p ‚Üî q meaning:

The biconditional statement p‚Üîq (read as "p if and only if q") means that:

p and q have the same truth value ‚Äî either both are true, or both are false.

p ‚â° q meaning:

Logical equivalence. This indicates that propositions p and ùëû always have the same truth value in all possible cases ‚Äî that is, their truth tables match.

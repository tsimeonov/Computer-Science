#### The representation of a set using Venn diagrams

1. Union (A ∪ B)

- Elements that are in A, B, or both.
- Set notation: A ∪ B = { x ∣ x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

2. Intersection (A ∩ B)

- Elements that are in both A and B.
- Set notation: A ∩ B = { x ∣ x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

3. Difference (A − B)

- Elements in A but not in B.
- Set notation: A − B = { x ∣ x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

4. Symmetric Difference (A △ B)

- Elements in A or B but not both.
- Set notation: A △ B = ( A − B ) ∪ ( B − A )

Example:

Let

- A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
- B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

Then:

- A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- A ∩ B = {3, 4}
- A − B = {1, 2}
- A △ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}

#### De Morgan's laws

In Discrete Mathematics, De Morgan's Laws play a crucial role in `logic`, `set theory`, and `Boolean algebra`. Here's how they are applied in those contexts:

🔷 1. In Propositional Logic (used in discrete math for logical statements):

Let 𝑃 and Q be propositions (statements that are either true or false).

De Morgan’s Laws:

- First Law:

¬ ( P ∧ Q ) ≡ ( ¬ P ) ∨ ( ¬ Q )

"Not (P and Q)" is logically equivalent to "Not P or Not Q".

- Second Law:

¬ ( P ∨ Q ) ≡ ( ¬ P ) ∧ ( ¬ Q )

"Not (P or Q)" is logically equivalent to "Not P and Not Q".

These are used in simplifying logical expressions and constructing truth tables.

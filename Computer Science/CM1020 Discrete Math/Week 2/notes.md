#### The representation of a set using Venn diagrams

1. Union (A ∪ B)
-   Elements that are in A, B, or both.
-   Set notation: A ∪ B = { x ∣ x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

2. Intersection (A ∩ B)
- Elements that are in both A and B.
- Set notation: A ∩ B = { x ∣ x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

3. Difference (A − B)
- Elements in A but not in B.
- Set notation: A − B = { x ∣ x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

4. Symmetric Difference (A △ B)
- Elements in A or B but not both.
- Set notation: A △ B = ( A − B ) ∪ ( B − A )

Example:
Let
- A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
- B = {3, 4, 5, 6}
  
Then:
- A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- A ∩ B = {3, 4}
- A − B = {1, 2}
- A △ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}

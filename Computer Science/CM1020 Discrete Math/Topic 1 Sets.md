1 . Define a set, the elements of a set and the cardinality of a set

A set is simply a collection of distinct objects, like a list of your favorite colors or the numbers 1,2 and 3.
The elements of a set are the individual objects in it. So, in a set of your favorite colors, each color is an element. The cardinality of a set is the total count of elements in that set.

  <summary>1.1 Understanding Sets and Elements:</summary>

  <br/>

Think of a set as a container, like a lunchbox. The items you put inside your lunchbox are the elements of that set. The only rule is that each element in the set must be unique.

In mathematics, we write sets using curly braces `{}`.

For example, if we have a set of primary colors, lets call it C, we would write it like this:

C = {red, yellow, blue}

To say that an element belongs to a set, we use the symbol `∈`, which looks like a curvy “E”. It means “is an element of”.

So, we can say:

- `red ∈ C `(Read as: "red is an element of set C")
- `yellow ∈ C`
- `blue ∈ C`

But, green is not in our set, so we would write `green ∉ C`.

  <summary>1.2 Cardinality of a set:</summary>

  <br/>

<b>Cardinality</b> is just a fancy word for the number of elements in a set.
That's it! If you can count, you can find the cardinality.

We show cardinality by putting two vertical bars around the set's name, like this: ∣A∣.

Let's use our set of primary colors from before:

C = {red, yellow, blue}

To find the cardinality, we just count the elements. There are three colors in the set. So, the cardinality of C is 3, which we write as:

`∣C∣ = 3`

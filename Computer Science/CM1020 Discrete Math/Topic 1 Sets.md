1 . Define a set, the elements of a set and the cardinality of a set

A set is simply a collection of distinct objects, like a list of your favorite colors or the numbers 1,2 and 3.
The elements of a set are the individual objects in it. So, in a set of your favorite colors, each color is an element. The cardinality of a set is the total count of elements in that set.

  <summary>1.1 Understanding Sets and Elements:</summary>

  <br/>

Think of a set as a container, like a lunchbox. The items you put inside your lunchbox are the elements of that set. The only rule is that each element in the set must be unique.

In mathematics, we write sets using curly braces `{}`.

For example, if we have a set of primary colors, lets call it C, we would write it like this:

C = {red, yellow, blue}

To say that an element belongs to a set, we use the symbol `∈`, which looks like a curvy “E”. It means “is an element of”.

So, we can say:

- `red ∈ C `(Read as: "red is an element of set C")
- `yellow ∈ C`
- `blue ∈ C`

But, green is not in our set, so we would write `green ∉ C`.

  <summary>1.2 Cardinality of a set:</summary>

  <br/>

<b>Cardinality</b> is just a fancy word for the number of elements in a set.
That's it! If you can count, you can find the cardinality.

We show cardinality by putting two vertical bars around the set's name, like this: ∣A∣.

Let's use our set of primary colors from before:

C = {red, yellow, blue}

To find the cardinality, we just count the elements. There are three colors in the set. So, the cardinality of C is 3, which we write as:

`∣C∣ = 3`

  <summary>1.3 Types of sets:</summary>

  <br/>

1. Finite Sets

A <b>finite set</b> is a set where you can count all the elements and the counting eventually stops.

2. Infinite sets

An <b>infinite</b> set is a set that goes on forever. You could never finish counting its elements. A classic example is the set of all positive whole numbers, W

`W = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 …}`

The three dots `...` (called an ellipsis) mean that the first list continues forever following the same pattern.

3. The empty set

The <b>empty set</b> (or null set) is a set that has no elements at all. Its cardinality is 0. An example would be the set of fish that can fly. Since there is no one, the set is empty.
We write the empty set using the symbol ∅ or just empty curly braces `{}`.

So , if F is the set of flying fish, we would say F = ∅m and |F| = 0

#### `The definition of a function`

<details>
  <summary>Introduction</summary>
  
A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output to each input from a given set.

The concept of a funciton is a central to computer programming.

Most of what a programmer writes consists of "functions" that do parts of the work of the program.

  <summary>Terminology</summary>
  
Given a function: `f: A -> B`

`x ∈ A -> f(x) = y ∈ B`

A is the set of inputs and is called the domain of f. We write $D_f$ = A .
B is the set containing the outputs and is called the co-domain of f. We
write co-$D_f$ = B.

The set of outputs is called the range of f and it is written as $R_f$.

y is called the image of x, whereas x is called the pre-image of y.
We write `f(x) = y`

  <summary>Exercise 1</summary>

  <br/>
  
Given the following function: f:  Z -> Z with f(x) = |x|

🔍 Step-by-step explanation:

1. Notation:

- f is a function.
- Z is the set of all integers:

        Z = {...,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,...}

- So f : Z → Z means:

  - The domain is Z (you can plug in any integer)
  - The co-domain is also Z (outputs are expected to be integers)

  2. Function rule:

  f(x)=∣x∣

This is the absolute value function, which means:

- If x ≥ 0, then f(x) = x
- If x < 0, then f(x) = −x

So for example:

- f(3) = ∣3∣ = 3
- f(−3) = ∣−3∣ = 3
- f(0) = ∣0∣ = 0

`Summary`

- Domain: Z
- Co-domain: Z
- Range (actual output): Z = {0,1,2,3,4...}

#### `Plotting a function`

  <summary>Linear function</summary>
  
  f(x) = mx + b

- A `linear function `is a function whose graph is a straight line
- m: Slope (rate of change)
- b: Y-intercept (ehere the line crosses the y-axis)

Example: f(x) = 2x + 1

This is a straight line with:

- Slope (m) = 2

- Y-intercept (b) = 1

<details>
  <summary>Increasing Linear Function</summary>
  
An `increasing linear function` is a function whose `slope` is `positive`, meaning the graph goes `up` as you move from left to right

🧮 General Form: f(x) = mx + b where m > 0

- m: Slope (positive for increasing)

- b: Y-intercept

✅ Example:

f(x) = 3x + 2

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 30px;">

<div>

  <summary>Decreasing Linear Function</summary>

A `descreasing linear function` is a function whose graph slopes `downwards` from left to right.
This happens when the `slope` m is `negative`.

🧮 General Form: f(x) = mx + b where m < 0

- m: the slope (negative for decreasing)
- b: the y-intercept

✅ Example:

f(x) = -3x + 2

📉 Key Properties:

- Slope (m): −3 → negative, so this is a decreasing linear function
- Y-intercept (b): 2 → the graph crosses the y-axis at(0,2)

  <summary>Quadratic function</summary>

🔺 What is a Quadratic Function?

A `quadratic function` is a polynomial of degree 2, and its graph is a parabola (a U-shaped curve).

🔺 What is a Polynomial?

A Polynomial is a mathematica expression consisting of variables, coefficien, integer expression.

🧮 General Form:

f(x) = $ax^2$ + bx + c

Where:

- a,b and c are real constants
- a ≠ 0

✅ Example:

f(x) = $x^2$ + 1

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 30px;">

  <summary>Exponential function</summary>

  <br/>

📈 What is an Exponential Function?

An exponential function is a function where the variable is in the exponent, typically used to model growth or decay.

🧮 General Form:

f(x) = $a*b^2$

Where:

- a = initial value (when
- b = base (rate of growth or decay)
  - If b > 1: exponential growth
  - If 0 < b < 1: exponential decay
- x = exponent (independent variable)

✅ Example:

f(x) = $2^x$

🔍 Key Characteristics:

- Base b = 2 → This is exponential growth
- Initial value f(0) = 1
- Domain: R (all real numbers)
- Range: (0,∞)
- Asymptote: Horizontal line at y = 0
- Always positive: f(x) > 0

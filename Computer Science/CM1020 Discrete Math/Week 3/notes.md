📘 `Definition of a Function (in Discrete Mathematics)`

A function is a special type of relation between two sets where each element in the domain is associated with exactly one element in the codomain.

✅ `Formal Definition`:

Let A and B be two sets. A function 𝑓 from A to B, written as:

𝑓 : 𝐴 → 𝐵

is a rule that assigns exactly one element 𝑓 ( 𝑎 ) ∈ 𝐵 to each element 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴.

🔷 `Key Terms`:

- Domain: The set of all input values (A).
- Codomain: The set of possible output values (B).
- Range: The set of actual output values { 𝑓 ( 𝑎) ∣ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 }, a subset of the codomain.

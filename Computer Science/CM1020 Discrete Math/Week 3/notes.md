A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output to each input from a given set.

The concept of a funciton is a central to computer programming.

Most of what a programmer writes consists of "functions" that do parts of the work of the program.

This function takes an element of the set 1 and maps it to an element of the set 2

  <summary>Definition of a function 2</summary>
  
`Definition`: A function `f` from a set `A` to a set `B` is an assignement of exactly one element of `B` to each element of `A`.

If f is a fucntion from A to B we write:
    
    `f: A -> B`

This can be read as `f maps A to B`


The expression

`x ‚àà A: x ‚Ü¶ f(x) = y where¬†y ‚àà B`

is read as: "For each element x in set A , x is mapped to f(x) = y, where y is in set B"

Breakdown:

- x ‚àà A: "x is an element of set A" (the domain)
- x ‚Üí f(x): "x is mapped to f(x)"
- f(x) = y: "the output of the function f at x is y"
- y ‚àà B: "y belongs to set B" (the codomain)

  <summary>Terminology</summary>
  
Given a function: `f: A -> B` 

`x ‚àà A -> f(x) = y ‚àà B`

A is the set of inputs and is called the domain of f. We write $D_f$ = A .
B is the set containing the outputs and is called the co-domain of f. We 
write co-$D_f$ = B.

The set of outputs is called the range of f and it is written as $R_f$.

y is called the image of x, whereas x is called the pre-image of y.
We write `f(x) = y`

Domain: $D_f$ = A = {on, sea, land, sky}

Co-domain: Co-$D_f$ = B = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Range: $R_f$ = {2,3,4}

  <summary>Exercise 1</summary>

  <br/>
  
Given the following function: f:  Z -> Z with f(x) = |x|

üîç Step-by-step explanation:

1. Notation:

- f is a function.
- Z is the set of all integers:

        Z = {...,‚àí3,‚àí2,‚àí1,0,1,2,3,...}

- So f : Z ‚Üí Z means:

    - The domain is Z (you can plug in any integer) 
    - The co-domain is also Z (outputs are expected to be integers)

    2. Function rule:

    f(x)=‚à£x‚à£

This is the absolute value function, which means:

-   If x ‚â• 0, then f(x) = x
- If  x < 0, then f(x) = ‚àíx

So for example:
- f(3) = ‚à£3‚à£ = 3
- f(‚àí3) = ‚à£‚àí3‚à£ = 3
- f(0) = ‚à£0‚à£ = 0

`Summary`

- Domain: Z
- Co-domain: Z
- Range (actual output): Z = {0,1,2,3,4...}

  <summary>Linear function</summary>
  
  f(x) = mx + b

  - A `linear function `is a function whose graph is a straight line
  - m: Slope (rate of change)
  - b: Y-intercept (ehere the line crosses the y-axis)

Example: f(x) = 2x + 1

This is a straight line with:

- Slope (m) = 2

- Y-intercept (b) = 1

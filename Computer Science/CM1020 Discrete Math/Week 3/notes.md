A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output to each input from a given set.

The concept of a funciton is a central to computer programming.

Most of what a programmer writes consists of "functions" that do parts of the work of the program.

This function takes an element of the set 1 and maps it to an element of the set 2

  <summary>Definition of a function 2</summary>
  
`Definition`: A function `f` from a set `A` to a set `B` is an assignement of exactly one element of `B` to each element of `A`.

If f is a fucntion from A to B we write:
    
    `f: A -> B`

This can be read as `f maps A to B`


The expression

`x ∈ A: x ↦ f(x) = y where y ∈ B`

is read as: "For each element x in set A , x is mapped to f(x) = y, where y is in set B"

Breakdown:

- x ∈ A: "x is an element of set A" (the domain)
- x → f(x): "x is mapped to f(x)"
- f(x) = y: "the output of the function f at x is y"
- y ∈ B: "y belongs to set B" (the codomain)

  <summary>Terminology</summary>
  
Given a function: `f: A -> B` 

`x ∈ A -> f(x) = y ∈ B`

A is the set of inputs and is called the domain of f. We write $D_f$ = A .
B is the set containing the outputs and is called the co-domain of f. We 
write co-$D_f$ = B.

The set of outputs is called the range of f and it is written as $R_f$.

y is called the image of x, whereas x is called the pre-image of y.
We write `f(x) = y`

`Question 1 (A) i`

Step 1: X ∩ Y ∩ Z

- X ∩ Y = {4,6,8,10}
- ( X ∩ Y ) ∩ Z = { 10 }

The Answer is: X ∩ Y ∩ Z = {10}

Step 2: Y ∖ Z (elements inY but not in Z)

- Y = {4,6,8,10,12}
- Z = {2,10,12,14,16}

So:

Y∖Z={4,6,8}

Now: X ∪ (Y∖Z)

- X = {2,4,6,8,10}
- Y ∖ Z={4,6,8}

So the union is:

X ∪ (Y∖Z) = {2,4,6,8,10}

`Question 1 (A) ii`

- X = {2,4,6,8,10}
- X ∩ Y ∩ Z = {10}

Clearly, X ∉ {10}

The anser is No, X ∉ X ∩ Y ∩ Z because elements like 2, 4, 6, and 8 are in X but not in the intersection.

`Question 1 (A) i`

Step 1: X ∩ Y ∩ Z

- X ∩ Y = {4,6,8,10}
- ( X ∩ Y ) ∩ Z = { 10 }

The Answer is: X ∩ Y ∩ Z = {10}

Step 2: Y ∖ Z (elements inY but not in Z)

- Y = {4,6,8,10,12}
- Z = {2,10,12,14,16}

So:

Y∖Z={4,6,8}

Now: X ∪ (Y∖Z)

- X = {2,4,6,8,10}
- Y ∖ Z={4,6,8}

So the union is:

X ∪ (Y∖Z) = {2,4,6,8,10}

`Question 1 (A) ii`

- X = {2,4,6,8,10}
- X ∩ Y ∩ Z = {10}

Clearly, X ∉ {10}

The anser is No, X ∉ X ∩ Y ∩ Z because elements like 2, 4, 6, and 8 are in X but not in the intersection.

`Question 1 (A) iii`

Step 1: Y ∩ Z = {10,12}
Step 2: X ∪ ( Y ∩ Z) = {2,4,6,8,10,12}

This set has 6 elements.

So:∣ P ( X ∪ ( Y ∩ Z ) )∣= $2^6$ =64

`Question 1 (B)`

The only sets A satisfying P (A) ⊆ {∅,{∅},{{∅}}} are:

- A=∅,
- A={∅}
- A={{∅}}

`Question 1 (C)`

- (⇒) If A ⊆ B, then any element in A ∩ C is also in
  B ∩ C. So the inclusion holds.
- (⇐) If A ∩ C ⊆ B ∩ C for all C, choose C = A. Then:
  A ∩ A = A ⊆ B ∩ A ⊆ B
  A ⊆ B must hold.

The statement is correct

`Question 1 (D)`

A ⊆ B and C ⊆ B only mean both sets are inside B, but they can still share elements.

Being subsets of the same set does not imply disjointness.

`Question 2 (A) i`

f(x) is not defined for all x ∈ R

So f is not a function from R to R

1. The Definition of a Set

    <summary>1.1 Introduction</summary>

<br/>

A set is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science. It’s a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Sets are used to group related items together and to perform operations on these groups

     <summary>1.2 Definition of a set</summary>

<br/>

Definition 1. A set is a collection of objects. The objects in a set are called its elements or members. The elements in a set can be any types of objects, including sets! The members of a set do not even have to be of the same type. For example, although it may not have any meaningful application, a set can consist of numbers and names.

Definition 2. A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements.
For example: The set of primary colours can be written as {red, blue, yellow}
Elements of a set are also called members.

1.3 Notation

Sets are usually denoted by capital letters, and their elements are listed within curly braces. For example the set A containing elements 1, 2, and 3 can be written as

A = {1,2,3}A

     <summary>1.3.1 Element or member of set (∈)</summary>

<br/>

The symbol ∈ denotes membership. If a is an element of a set A, we write a ∈ A

For example:

The set

A = {1,2,3} is a set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3.

We write:

1 ∈ A means 1 is an element of A

2 ∈ A means 2 is an element of A

3 ∈ A means 3 is an element of A

We refer to not a member of a set using the symbol ∉. If a is not an element of a set A, we write a ∉ A

For example: let A be a set with A = {1,2,3}.
Clearly 4 is not an element of A. We write 4 ∉ A.

     <summary>1.3.2 Special sets of numbers</summary>

We designate these notations for some special sets of numbers:

N = the set of natural numbers (positive integers)

Z = the set of integers

Q = the set of rational numbers

R = the set of real numbers

     <summary>1.3.3. Empty set (∅)</summary>

The empty set, also known as the `null set`, is a fundamental concept in set theory and mathematics.
It is the set that contains no elements.

`Definition 3`. The empty set is a set with no elements. It is denoted by ∅ or {}.

In mathematical notation ∅ = {}

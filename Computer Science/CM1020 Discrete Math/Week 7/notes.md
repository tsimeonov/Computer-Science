### Topic 4A. Predicate logic

#### `Introduction to predicate logic`

`Predicated logic` is a more powerful form of logic than `propositional logic`.
While propositional logic deals with statements that have fixed truth values, it cannot express complex of varialbel-dependent statenetsm such as:

- "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man, Therefore, Socrates is mortal
- "$x^2$ = 4" (truth depends on the value of x)

Predicate logic overcomes these limitations by allowing reasoning with `variables` and `quantifiers` enabling more complex and precise logical expressions

#### `What are predicates?`

  <summary>Insufficiency of propositional logic</summary>

Given the statement: "`x` squared is equal to 4"

- It's not a proposition, as it's truth value is a `function` depending on x
- This `can't be` expressed with `propositional logic`, but `predicate lofic` will `enable` us ti formalise it

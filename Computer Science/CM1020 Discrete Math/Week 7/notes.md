### Topic 4A. Predicate logic

#### `Introduction to predicate logic`

`Predicated logic` is a more powerful form of logic than `propositional logic`.
While propositional logic deals with statements that have fixed truth values, it cannot express complex of varialbel-dependent statenetsm such as:

- "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man, Therefore, Socrates is mortal
- "$x^2$ = 4" (truth depends on the value of x)

Predicate logic overcomes these limitations by allowing reasoning with `variables` and `quantifiers` enabling more complex and precise logical expressions

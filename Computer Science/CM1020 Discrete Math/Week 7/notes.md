### Topic 4A. Predicate logic

#### `Introduction to predicate logic`

`Predicated logic` is a more powerful form of logic than `propositional logic`.
While propositional logic deals with statements that have fixed truth values, it cannot express complex of varialbel-dependent statenetsm such as:

- "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man, Therefore, Socrates is mortal
- "$x^2$ = 4" (truth depends on the value of x)

Predicate logic overcomes these limitations by allowing reasoning with `variables` and `quantifiers` enabling more complex and precise logical expressions

#### `What are predicates?`

  <summary>Insufficiency of propositional logic</summary>

Given the statement: "`x` squared is equal to 4"

- It's not a proposition, as it's truth value is a `function` depending on x
- This `can't be` expressed with `propositional logic`, but `predicate lofic` will `enable` us ti formalise it

  <summary>Definitions of a predicate</summary>

- `Predicates` are a more `general` form of `proposition`
- Predicates behave as `functions`whose values are `T or F` depending on their varialbes
- Predicates `become propositions` when their variables are `given` actual `values`

- The statement "x squared is equal to 4" has two parts:

  - The `variable` x, which is the subject of the statement
  - The `predicate` "squared is equal to 4", which is the property that the subject of the statement can have

- This statement can be formalised as `P(x)` where P is the predicate "squared is equal to 4" and x is the variable

- `P` is said to be the `propositional function`
- Once a value is assigned to the variable x, the statement P(x)
  becomes a proposition and has a truth value.

    <summary>Example</summary>

- Let `x` be an integer
- Let `P` be the propositional function "squared is eqaul to 4"

- Let ecaluate P(x) for specific values of the variable x:
  - P(2) is `True`
  - P(3) is `False`

#### Quantification

<details>
     <summary>Quantifiers</summary>

     - Quantification expresses th extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elementss

     - they express the meaning of the words all and some

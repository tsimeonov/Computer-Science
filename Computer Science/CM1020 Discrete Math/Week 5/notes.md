#### `Introduction to propositional logic`

Propositional logic is a branch of logic focused on mathematical statements and reasoning. It is described as an `algebra of propositions` using logical operators like and, or, not, implies, and if and only if. Applications include `circuit design, logic programming` and `AI systems` such as `theorem provers` and `program verifiers`

#### `Propositions`

A `proposition` is a `mathematical statement` this is either true or false but not both.
Examples

- "London is the capital of UK" (true)
- "3<2" (false)

Sentences like questions or vague statements aren't propositions.
To simplify expressions, `propositional variables` like p, q, r are used to represent these statements.

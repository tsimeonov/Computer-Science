E### The definition of a set

#### Definition of a set

A set is a collection of objects. The objects in a set are called its elements or members. The elements in a set can be any type of objects, including sets. The members of a set do not have to be of the same type.

#### Notation

Sets are usually denoted by capital letters and their elements are listed with curly braces.
For example the set A containing elements 1, 2 and 3 can be written as A = {1,2,3....}

#### The listing method and rule of inclusion

1. `Listing Method (Roster method)`

- You list all the elements of a set explicitly separated by commas, and place them inside curly braces {}
- This method shows exactly which elements are in the set

Example:

A = {2,4,6,8}

- Set A contains exactly 2,4,6 and 8

2. `Rule of inclusion (Set-Builder Method)`

- You describe the property or rule that all elements of the set satisfy, instead if listing them individually.
- Usually written using a vertical bar | or colon : meaning "such that".

Example:

A = {x âˆˆ N | x is an even x < 10}

- This says "A is the set of all natural numbers x such that x is even and less than 10"

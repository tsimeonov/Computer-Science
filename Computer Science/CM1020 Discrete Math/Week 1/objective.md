### Learning Objective

#### Topic 1: SETS 

##### Define a set, the elements of a set and the cardinality of a set.

<details>
  <summary>Define a set</summary>
  
A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as a whole.
These objects are called elements or members of the set.
  - Sets are usually denoted by capital letters (e.g, A,B,S)
  - Elements are typically inside curly braces: A = {1,2,3}

  <summary>Elements of a set</summary>
  
The elements of a set are the individual objects or memebers contained in the set.
  - If an element a belongs to set A, we write a ∈ A
  - If it does not belong, we write a ∉ B

<details>
  <summary>Cardinality of a set</summary>
  
The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set.
  - Denoted by vertical bars: |A|
  - Example if A = {2,4,6}, then |A| = 3

##### Explain the concept of Venn diagrams and how they are used to represent and compare different set expressions.

<details>
  <summary>What is Venn Diagram?</summary>

  A Venn diagram is a visual way to reperesnt sets and their relationships using overlapping cicles.
  Each circle represents a set, and the overlapping areas show where the sets share common elements (i.e interactions).
  The universal set (everyting under consideration) is often shown as a rectangle containing all the circles.

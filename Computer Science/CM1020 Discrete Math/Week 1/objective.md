### Learning Objective

#### Topic 1: SETS

##### Define a set, the elements of a set and the cardinality of a set.

<details>
  <summary>Define a set</summary>

A `set` is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as a whole.
These objects are called elements or members of the set.

- Sets are usually denoted by capital letters (e.g, A,B,S)
- Elements are typically inside curly braces: A = {1,2,3}

<details>
  <summary>Elements of a set</summary>

The `elements` of a set are the individual objects or members contained in the set.

- If an element a belongs to set A, we write a ∈ A
- If it does not belong, we write a ∉ B

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cardinality of a set</summary>

The `cardinality` of a set is the number of elements in the set.

- Denoted by vertical bars: |A|
- Example if A = {2,4,6}, then |A| = 3

##### Explain the concept of Venn diagrams and how they are used to represent and compare different set expressions.

<details>
  <summary>What is Venn Diagram?</summary>

A `Venn diagram` is a visual way to represent sets and their relationships using overlapping circles.
Each circle represents a set, and the `overlapping areas` show where the sets share common elements (i.e interactions).
The universal set (everything under consideration) is often shown as a rectangle containing all the circles.

  <summary>How Venn diagrams represent set expressions:</summary>

1. `Union` (A ∪ B)

- Includes `all elements` in `A`, `B` or `both`
- Represented by the `total area` covered by both circles

2. `Intersection` ( A ∩ B)

- Includes elements `common` to both A and B
- Represented by the `overlapping` area of the circles

3. `Difference` (A -- B `or` A \ B)

- Elements in A that are not in B
- Represented by the part of A's circle that `doesn't overlap` with B

4. `Complement` (A')

- All elements not in A, relative to the `universal set`
- Represented by the area outside A's circle, inside the rectangle

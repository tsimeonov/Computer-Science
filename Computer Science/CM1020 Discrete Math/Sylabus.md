Course Description

Discrete mathematics covers mathematical topics relating to discrete structures and processes that students of computer science will encounter throughout their study. This module helps you hone your skills in thinking abstractly. This module covers widely applicable mathematical tools for computer science, including topics from logic, set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. It includes practice in reasoning formally and proving theorems. It helps learning to reason rigorously, and to distinguish correct from faulty mathematical arguments.

Through this module, you will develop the fundamental discrete mathematical tools that will support you throughout the BSc Computer Science programme. You will learn a wide range of the discrete mathematical concepts and techniques that underpin Computer Science.

Learning Activities of This Course

The course is comprised of the following elements:

- Lecture videos. In each module the key concepts will be presented through a collection of short video lectures. You may stream these videos for playback within the browser by clicking on their titles or download the videos.

- Readings. Each topic may include several suggested readings. These are a core part of your learning, and, together with the videos, will cover all of the concepts you need for this course.

- Practice Quizzes. Each topic will include practice quizzes, intended for you to assess your understanding of the key concepts. End of topic quizzes in the second half of the course will not contribute to your final grade, but will provide important practice for your exam. You will be allowed unlimited attempts at each practice quiz. Each attempt may present a different selection of questions to you. There is no time limit on how long you take to complete each attempt at the quiz. All practice quizzes do not contribute toward your final score in the course.

- Graded Quizzes. Every topic in Topics 1–5 will include at least one summative quiz. These will be at the end of the week and clearly labelled as ‘Summative quiz’. These quizzes will contribute to your coursework grade. You will be allowed two attempts per quiz. Your average score will be used when calculating your final score for the summative quiz. You must wait at least 8 hours before taking your second attempt at the quiz.

- Peer Reviewed Assignments. Topics 1-5 include peer reviewed assignments. These exercises will test your understanding of the concepts. You will read a short prompt, then perform a task in response. You will then be required to review three of your peers' submissions. Peer reviewed assignments will not contribute to your final grade, but will be valuable practice for your coursework and exam.

- Discussion Prompt. Each topic include discussion prompts. You will see the discussion prompt alongside other items in the lesson. Each prompt provides a space for you to respond. After responding, you can see and comment on your peers' responses. All prompts and responses are also accessible from your private group discussion forum.

How to Pass This Course
The course has two major assessments each worth 50% of your grade:
Coursework: this consists of several activities that you do on the Coursera platform and which will be assessed half way through the course.
Written examination: this will be an online timed assessment.
There are also peer reviews in every topic that are graded but have 0 weight. That means that they will not count towards your final grade, but they are a key part of your learning and you need to do them.
The mark shown on the Coursera platform is your coursework mark and you should remember that the exam counts for another 50%.
The assessment consists of several activities. This is a detailed breakdown of all of the marks.

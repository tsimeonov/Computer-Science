  <summary>Origins of Markup</summary>
  
<br>

- `RUNOFF (1964)`: One of the first markup languages, using "control words" (like `.he` for heading, `.ce` for center) scattered in text to control formatting. It mexed `semantic` information (like identifying a heading) with purely `formatting` instructions
- `GML (Generalized Markup Language, 1970s)`: Developed by Goldfarb, focused more strongly on serarating the `logiacl structure` (semantic elements like quotes `:q` or list items `:li`) from formatting instructions.

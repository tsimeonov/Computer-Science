What and why markup?

<details>
  <summary>Origins of Markup</summary>
  
<br>

- `RUNOFF (1964)`: One of the first markup languages, using "control words" (like `.he` for heading, `.ce` for center) scattered in text to control formatting. It mexed `semantic` information (like identifying a heading) with purely `formatting` instructions
- `GML (Generalized Markup Language, 1970s)`: Developed by Goldfarb, focused more strongly on serarating the `logiacl structure` (semantic elements like quotes `:q` or list items `:li`) from formatting instructions.

  <summary>What is Hypertext?</summary>

- `Nonlinear`: Unlike a conventional book, it's not meant to be read sequentially. Users can jump around.
- `Machine-Supported`: It relies on a computer for "interactive branching" and dynamic display.
- `Linked`: It uses links to connect documents or points within a document, which is what enables the nonlinear organization.

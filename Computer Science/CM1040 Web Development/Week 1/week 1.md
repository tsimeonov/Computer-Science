  <summary>Quick history of the internet: From Arpanet to the 80s</summary>
  
<br>

The history of the Internet began in the 1960s with the `ARPANET`, a US project created by the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) in response to the Cold War arms race.

A key innovation was the shift to `packet switching`, which breaks data into small pieces for more robust and efficient transmissions. The fist ARPANET node was established in 1969.

During the 1970s, the network expanded, `email` was invented, and a public demo in 1972 sparked wilder interest, leadning to a "wild west" period of many incompatible networks.

The turning point came in the early 1980s when ARPANET officially adopted the `RCP/IP` protocol, creating a universal standard for communication. This, combined with the formation of large educational networks, set the stage for the modern Internet.

The era culminated in `1989` with the launch of the first commercial `Internet Service provider (ISP)` in the US, making the network publicly accessible and leadning to its exponential growth.

  <summary>From Web 1.0 to Society 5.0</summary>

- `Web 1.0 (The Read-only Web)`: Starting aroubd 1990 wiht Tim Berners-Lee's invention, this era was characterized by static web pages created by a small group of developers. The primary focus was on oublishing ang accesiing information, not user interaction.
- `Web 2.0 (The Social Web)`: Beginning in late 1990s and early 2000s, this phase marked the shift to "Read-Write" web. It empowered everydawy users to create and share content through blogs (Wordpress), social media (Facebook), and dynamic applications, enabled by technologies like AJAX and JSON.
- `Web 3.0 (The Semantic Web)`: This was a formal push by the W3C to create a more sturctures, machine-readable web using technologies like RFQ and OWL. The goal was for software to understand and reawson about data, but this vision was largely unrealized due to its complexity. Thisis distinct from the modern term `Web3`, which is base on blockchain technologie.

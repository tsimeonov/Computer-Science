<br>

The DOM is a "platform-neutral model" for documents like web pages. When a browser loads an HTML file, it creates a DOM version of that page.

This model serves two main purposes:

1. `For Programmers`: It provides a way for programmers to interact with the document. They can navigate its structure and add, modify or delete elements and content.
2. `For interactivity`: It defines a model for `events` such as a user clicking on an element which aloows web pages to become interactive.

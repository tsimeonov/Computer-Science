### Vectors and vector spaces

##### 1. Which of the following is NOT a way to represent a vector in two dimensions?

- Cartesian coordinates (x,y)
- Parametric form (t)
- Polar coordinates (r, θ)
- Unit vector form (i,j)

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The correct answer is:

**- Parametric form (t)**

Explanation:

1. **Cartesian coordinates (x, y)** – A vector in two dimensions can be represented by its components along the x and y axes, such as \( (x, y) \).
2. **Polar coordinates (r, θ)** – A vector can also be represented using its magnitude \( r \) (length) and direction \( \theta \) (angle).
3. **Unit vector form (i, j)** – A vector can be expressed in terms of unit vectors \( \hat{i} \) and \( \hat{j} \) as \( x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} \).

However, **parametric form (t)** is typically used to describe a curve or a line rather than a single vector. Parametric equations define how coordinates change with respect to a parameter \( t \), rather than directly describing a vector itself.

## Chapter 14, Number bases

### 14.1: The decimal system

When we use 10 as a base we say we are writting in the `decimal system`.

253 = 2(100) + 5(10) + (1)
    = 2(10^2^) + 5(10^1^) + (10^0^)

### 14.2: The binary system

A binary system uses base 2. A binary system has only two digits: 0 and 1. Numbers in base 2 are called `binary digits` or simply `bits` for short.

1101012 = 1(25) + 1(24) + 0(23) + 1(22) + 0(21) + 1(20) = 1(32) + 1(16) + 0(8) + 1(4) + 0(2) + 1(1) = 32 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 53

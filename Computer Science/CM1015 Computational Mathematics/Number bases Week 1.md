## Chapter 14, Number bases

### 14.1: The decimal system

When we use 10 as a base we say we are writting in the `decimal system`.

253 = 2(100) + 5(10) + (1)
= 2(10^2^) + 5(10^1^) + (10^0^)

### 14.2: The binary system

A binary system uses base 2. A binary system has only two digits: 0 and 1. Numbers in base 2 are called `binary digits` or simply `bits` for short.

1101012 = 1(2^5^) + 1(2^4^) + 0(2^3^) + 1(2^2^) + 0(2^1^) + 1(2^0^)
= 1(32) + 1(16) + 0(8) + 1(4) + 0(2) + 1(1)
= 32 + 16 + 4 + 1
= 531~10~

Hense 110101~2~ and 53~10~ are equivalent

<h5>Converting decimal to binary</h5>

### 14.3: Octal system

Octal numbers use 8 as a base.

328~8~ = 3(8^2^) + 2(8^1^) + 5(8^0^)

### 14.4: Hexadecimal system

The number systems whisch use 16 as a base are called `hexadecimal`. There are 16 digits in the hexadecimal system: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F.

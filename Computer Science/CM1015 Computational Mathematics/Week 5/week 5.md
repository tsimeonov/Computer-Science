## Learning Objectives:

- Describe modular number systems

A `modular number system` is a mathematical framework where numbers wrap around after reaching a certain value, called the `modulus`.
It forms the basis for the modular arithmetic, a system widely used in number theory, cryptography, computer science and many practical applications.

- Key Features of Modular Number Systems:

1. Modulus:
   - The modulus, denoted as `n`, determines the range of numbers
   - The numbers is a modular system are typically considered from 0 to n-1.

## Learning Objectives:

- Describe modular number systems

A `modular number system` is a mathematical framework where numbers wrap around after reaching a certain value, called the `modulus`.
It forms the basis for the modular arithmetic, a system widely used in number theory, cryptography, computer science and many practical applications.

- Key Features of Modular Number Systems:

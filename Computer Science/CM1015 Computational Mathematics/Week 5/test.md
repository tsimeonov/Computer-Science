## Introduction to modular arithmetic

1. What is modular arithmetic often compared to in order ro explain its concepts

- A number
- A calender
- A ruler
- A clock

<details>

- A clock.
  A modular arithmetic is often compared to a clock to explain its concepts because the numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value, just as hours on a clock reset to 1 after reaching 12.

2. In modular arithmetic, what does the term "mod" refer to?

- The sum of all numbers in the system
- The average of all numbers in the system
- The maximum value in the system
- The base number of the system

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- The base number if the system.
  In modular arithmetic , the term "mod" refers to the base number of the system, which is the number at which values wrap around.
  For example, in mod 5, numbers cycle back to 0 after reaching 4.

3. What is the equivalent of 34 mod 12?

- 10
- 22
- 12
- 2

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- The correct answer is 10.
  To calculate 34 mod 12, divide 34 by 12:
  34 / 12 = 2 (quotient) with remainder of 10.
  So, 34 mod 12 = 10

4. Which of the following is true about modular arithmetic with a base of 12?

- It includes numbers from 0 to 12.
- It includes numbers from 0 to 11.
- It includes numbers from 1 to 11.
- It includes numbers from 1 to 12.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- It includes numbers from 0 to 11.

In modular arithmetic with a base of 12, the numbers range from 0 to 11, as the modulus defines the numbers of unique remainders (starting from 0).
The number 12 would wrap around to 0.

5. What is the equivalent of -17 mod 12?

- -7
- -5
- 5
- 7

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- 7

To calculate -17 mod 12:

1. Divide -17 by 12: -17 / 12 = -1 (quotient) with a remainder of -5.
2. In modular arithmetic, the remainder must be positive, so add 12 to -5:
   -5 + 12 = 7

Thus, -17 mod 12 = 7

6. If 27 is equivalent to 3 in mod 12, what is 39 equivalent to in mod 12?

- 9
- 27
- 3
- 15

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- 3

To calculate 39 mod 12:

1. Divide 39 by 12 = 3 (quotient) with a remainder of 3.
2. So, 39 mod 12 = 3

Thus, 39 is equivalent to 3 in mod 12

7. In modular arithmetic, two numbers _a_ nd _b_ are equivalent mod _k_ if:

- _a/b_ is a multiple of _k_
- _a-b_ is a multiple of _k_
- _a\*b_ is a multiple of _k_
- _a+b_ is a multiple of _k_

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- _a-b_ is a multiple of _k_

In modular arithmetic, two numbers _a_ and _b_ are equivalent mod _k_ if their difference _a - b_ is divisible by _k_. This is written as:

a≡b (mod k)

which means:

_a - b = nk_ for some integer n

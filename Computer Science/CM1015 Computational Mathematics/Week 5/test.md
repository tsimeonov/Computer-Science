## Introduction to modular arithmetic

1. What is modular arithmetic often compared to in order ro explain its concepts

- A calender
- A ruler
- A clock

A clock.
A modular arithmetic is often compared to a clock to explain its concepts because the numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value, just as hours on a clock reset to 1 after reaching 12.

2. In modular arithmetic, what does the term "mod" refer to?

- The sum of all numbers in the system
- The average of all numbers in the system
- The maximum value in the system
- The base number of the system

The base number if the system.
In modular arithmetic , the term "mod" refers to the base number of the system, which is the number at which values wrap around.
For example, in mod 5, numbers cycle back to 0 after reaching 4.

3. What is the equivalent of 34 mod 12?

- 10
- 22
- 12
- 2

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The correct answer is 10.
To calculate 34 mod 12, divide 34 by 12:
34 / 12 = 2 (quotient) with remainder of 10.
So, 34 mod 12 = 10

4. Which of the following is true about modular arithmetic with a base of 12?

- It includes numbers from 0 to 12.
- It includes numbers from 0 to 11.
- It includes numbers from 1 to 11.
- It includes numbers from 1 to 12.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- It includes numbers from 0 to 11.

In modular arithmetic with a base of 12, the numbers range from 0 to 11, as the modulus defines the numbers of unique remainders (starting from 0).
The number 12 would wrap around to 0.

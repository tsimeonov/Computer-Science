1. Defining Congruence Modulo an IntegerThe concept of congruence (or equivalence) modulo an integer $k$ (the modulus) is central to modular arithmetic.

Two integers, $a$ and $b$, are defined as congruent modulo $k$ if they satisfy the following condition:

General Definition (Difference as a Multiple):

- $a$ and $b$ are congruent modulo $k$ if their difference $(a - b)$ is a multiple of $k$.

- This is expressed as: $a - b = m \cdot k$, where $m$ is some integer.

Alternative Definition (Same Remainder):

- $a$ and $b$ are congruent modulo $k$ if they have the same remainder ($r$) when divided by $k$.

- This means $a = n \cdot k + r$ and $b = m \cdot k + r$.Notation:Congruence is written as $a \equiv b \pmod{k}$.

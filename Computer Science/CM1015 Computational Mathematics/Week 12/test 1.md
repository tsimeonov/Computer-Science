### Trigonometric functions, plots and properties

1. **Which of the following statements is true about the cosine function?**

- Cosine is an odd function
- Cosine 𝜃 is equal to cosine of -𝜃
- Cosine of 𝜃 has a period of ∏
- Cosine of -𝜃 is equal to -cos(𝜃)

The correct statement is:

**Cosine 𝜃 is equal to cosine of -𝜃**

Explanation:\*\*

1. **Cosine is an odd function:**
   This is false. A function \( f(\theta) \) is odd if \( f(-\theta) = -f(\theta) \). However, cosine is an even function because \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta) \).

2. **Cosine 𝜃 is equal to cosine of -𝜃:**
   This is true. As mentioned, cosine is an even function, so \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta) \).

3. **Cosine of 𝜃 has a period of ∏:**
   This is false. The cosine function has a period of \( 2\pi \), not \( \pi \). (While some trigonometric functions or combinations might have a period of \( \pi \), the standard cosine function does not.)

4. **Cosine of -𝜃 is equal to -cos(𝜃):**
   This is false. Again, since cosine is even, \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta) \), not \(-\cos(\theta)\).

Thus, the only true statement is that cosine of 𝜃 is equal to cosine of -𝜃.

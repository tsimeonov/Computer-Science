1. Working with Angles and Angle Units

A. Angle Units

- Degrees: A full rotation is $360^{\circ}$. A straight line defines an angle of $180^{\circ}$. A perpendicular line creates a right angle of $90^{\circ}$.

- Radians: A radian is the angle subtended when the arc length is equal to the radius ($r$). A full circle measures $2\pi$ radians.

B. Conversion

The relationship between the two units is: $360^{\circ} = 2\pi$ radians.

- Degrees to Radians: Multiply the degree measure by $\frac{\pi}{180}$.
- Radians to Degrees: Multiply the radian measure by $\frac{180}{\pi}$

2. Deriving and Applying Basic Properties and Trigonometric Relations in Triangles

A. General Triangle Properties

- Angle Sum: The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always $180^{\circ}$ ($A + B + C = 180^{\circ}$).

- Area: $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.

- Perimeter: The perimeter is the sum of the three side lengths ($a + b + c$).

- Similar Triangles: Triangles with identical corresponding angles but potentially different side lengths.

- Special Triangles:
  - Equilateral: All sides and angles are equal; all angles are $60^{\circ}$.
  - Isosceles: Two sides and the two opposite angles are equal.

B. Right-Angled Triangles and Fundamental Identities

In a right-angled triangle (containing one $90^{\circ}$ angle), sides are labeled relative to an angle $\theta$:

- Hypotenuse (H): Opposite the $90^{\circ}$ angle.

- Opposite (O): Opposite the angle $\theta$.

- Adjacent (A): Next to the angle $\theta$.

- Pythagorean Theorem: Relates the side lengths:$$H^2 = O^2 + A^2$$

- Pythagorean Trigonometric Identity: Derived from the theorem:$$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$$

- Exact Values: The isosceles right-angled triangle ($45^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}$) yields the exact value:
  $$\sin(45^{\circ}) = \cos(45^{\circ}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

3. Solving Basic Problems with Sine and Cosine Rules

The primary tools for relating angles and sides in a right-angled triangle are the SOH CAH TOA ratios:

|          Ratio          |                 Definition                  |                                 Application                                 |
| :---------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Sine ($\sin \theta$)   | $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$ |       Used to find the height (Opposite) relative to the hypotenuse.        |
| Cosine ($\cos \theta$)  | $\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$ | Used to find the horizontal distance (Adjacent) relative to the hypotenuse. |
| Tangent ($\tan \theta$) |  $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$  |                     Used to find the gradient (slope).                      |

- Sine/Cosine Rules (General Triangles): While the source materials focus on right-angled triangles, these rules are used to solve for unknown side lengths or angles in non-right-angled triangles.

  - Law of Sines: $\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$

  - Law of Cosines: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$

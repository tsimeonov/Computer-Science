1. Working with Angles and Angle Units

A. Angle Units

- Degrees: A full rotation is $360^{\circ}$. A straight line defines an angle of $180^{\circ}$. A perpendicular line creates a right angle of $90^{\circ}$.

- Radians: A radian is the angle subtended when the arc length is equal to the radius ($r$). A full circle measures $2\pi$ radians.

B. Conversion

The relationship between the two units is: $360^{\circ} = 2\pi$ radians.

- Degrees to Radians: Multiply the degree measure by $\frac{\pi}{180}$.
- Radians to Degrees: Multiply the radian measure by $\frac{180}{\pi}$

- egrees: A full circle measures 360 degrees . A straight line defines an angle of 180 degrees.

- Direction: In this geometric space, movement is typically measured anticlockwise as a positive direction.

- Perpendicular: Dropping a perpendicular line divides a straight angle (180 degrees) exactly in half.

- Right Angle: The resulting 90-degree angle is a critical concept called a right angle.

  <summary>2. General Triangle Properties</summary>

  <br>

A triangle is formed by the intersection of three straight lines (segments).

- Standard Labeling: Angles are typically labeled with capital letters (A, B, C), and the side length opposite that angle is labeled with the corresponding lowercase letter (a, b, c).

- Angle Sum Property: The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees ($A + B + C = 180^{\circ}$).

- Area Formula: The area of a triangle is calculated using its base ($b$) and perpendicular height ($h$):

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$$

- Perimeter: The perimeter is simply the sum of the three side lengths ($a + b + c$).

  <summary>3. Important triangle types</summary>

  <br>

- Isosceles Triangle: A triangle that has two equal sides and, consequently, the two angles opposite those sides are also equal.

  - Example: If the third angle is $70^{\circ}$, the two equal angles must each be $55^{\circ}$ ($180 - 70 = 110$; $110 / 2 = 55$).

- Equilateral Triangle: A triangle where all three sides are equal and, consequently, all three angles are equal.

  - Since $3 \times A = 180^{\circ}$, each angle must be $\mathbf{60 \text{ degrees}}$.

- Similar Triangles: Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are identical. Their side lengths, sizes, and orientations may differ.

  <summary>4. Right-Angled Triangles and Pythagoras</summary>

  <br>

A right-angled triangle is a triangle that contains one 90-degree angle. This type of triangle has specialized terminology for its sides:

- Hypotenuse (H): The longest side, always opposite the 90-degree angle.

- Opposite (O): The side opposite the angle of interest (often labeled $\theta$).

- Adjacent (A): The side adjacent to (next to) the angle of interest ($\theta$), not the hypotenuse.

Pythagorean Theorem

This theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle: the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

$$\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \text{Opposite}^2 + \text{Adjacent}^2 \quad \text{or} \quad H^2 = O^2 + A^2$$

- Famous Example: The 3, 4, 5 triangle is the most famous right-angled triangle, as it satisfies the theorem: $5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2$, which simplifies to $25 = 9 + 16$.

### 7.2 The circle

<details>

  <summary>1. Defining the Circle</summary>

<br>

A circle is entirely defined by a central point (the origin) and the radius ($r$).

- Radius ($r$): The distance from the origin to any point on the circle's edgeShutterstock.

Key Formulas

- Circumference (C): The distance around the circle is given by:$$C = 2 \pi r$$

- Area (A): The space enclosed by the circle is given by:$$A = \pi r^2$$

- Degrees: A full rotation around the circle measures 360 degrees ($360^{\circ}$).

The Number Pi ($\pi$)

The constant $\pi$ is an irrational number because its decimal expansion never repeats and cannot be written as a simple fraction ($p/q$). Because $\pi$ cannot be stored exactly in a computer, calculations involving circles require careful consideration of the necessary degree of accuracy (e.g., using significant figures or decimal points).

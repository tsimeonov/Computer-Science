- egrees: A full circle measures 360 degrees . A straight line defines an angle of 180 degrees.

- Direction: In this geometric space, movement is typically measured anticlockwise as a positive direction.

- Perpendicular: Dropping a perpendicular line divides a straight angle (180 degrees) exactly in half.

- Right Angle: The resulting 90-degree angle is a critical concept called a right angle.

  <summary>2. General Triangle Properties</summary>

  <br>

A triangle is formed by the intersection of three straight lines (segments).

- Standard Labeling: Angles are typically labeled with capital letters (A, B, C), and the side length opposite that angle is labeled with the corresponding lowercase letter (a, b, c).

- Angle Sum Property: The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees ($A + B + C = 180^{\circ}$).

- Area Formula: The area of a triangle is calculated using its base ($b$) and perpendicular height ($h$):

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$$

- Perimeter: The perimeter is simply the sum of the three side lengths ($a + b + c$).

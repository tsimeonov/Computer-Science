#### The trigonometric ratios

Consider the right-angled triangle ABC in the figure below.
There is a right angle at B.

The side opposite the right angle is always called the `hypotenuse`.
So, in the figure the hypotenuse us AC. The side `opposite` _θ_ is BC. The remaining side, AB is said to be `adjacent` to _θ_ .

If we know the lights BC and AC we can calculate $\frac{BC}{AC}$.
This is known as the `sine` of _θ_ , or simply sin _θ_ . Similarly, we call $\frac{AB}{AC}$ the `cosine` of _θ_, written cos _θ_ .
Finally, $\frac{BC}{AB}$ is the `tangent` of _θ_, written tan _θ_.
Sine, cosine and tangent are known as the `trigonometric ratios`

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{side opposite to } \theta}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AC}
\]

\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{side adjacent to } \theta}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AB}{AC}
\]

\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{side opposite to } \theta}{\text{side adjacent to } \theta} = \frac{BC}{AB}
\]

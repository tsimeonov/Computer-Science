- egrees: A full circle measures 360 degrees . A straight line defines an angle of 180 degrees.

- Direction: In this geometric space, movement is typically measured anticlockwise as a positive direction.

- Perpendicular: Dropping a perpendicular line divides a straight angle (180 degrees) exactly in half.

- Right Angle: The resulting 90-degree angle is a critical concept called a right angle.

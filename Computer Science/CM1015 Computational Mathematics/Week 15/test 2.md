### Further differentiation 1

##### 1. What does the f'(x) represent in the differentiation?

- The integral of the function
- The value of the function at x
- The average rate of the change between two points
- The slope of the tangent line at x

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The correct answer is:

**The slope of the tangent line at x**

\( f'(x) \) represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of the function at \( x \), which is the **slope of the tangent line** to the curve at that point.

##### 2. Which of the following expressions defines the derivative of f(x) using limits?

- lim~h->0~ ${\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}}$
- lim~h->0~ ${\frac{f(x) - f(x-h)}{h}}$
- lim~h->0~ ${\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{h}}$
- lim~h->0~ ${\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}}$

  <summary>Solution</summary>

The correct answer is:

**\(\lim\_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\)**

This is the **definition of the derivative** of \( f(x) \) using limits. It represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of \( f(x) \) at \( x \), which is also the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.

Explanation of the other options:

- **\(\lim\_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x) - f(x-h)}{h}\)**:

  - This is similar to the correct definition but written in terms of backward differences. It is not the standard definition.

- **\(\lim\_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{h}\)**:

  - This expression is incorrect because it does not properly take the limit as \( h \to 0 \) in the standard form.

- **\(\lim\_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}\)**:
  - This is the **symmetric difference quotient**, an approximation for the derivative, but not its exact definition.

Thus, the first option is the correct definition of the derivative using limits. ðŸš€

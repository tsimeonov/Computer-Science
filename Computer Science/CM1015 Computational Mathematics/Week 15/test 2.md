### Further differentiation 1

##### 1. What does the f'(x) represent in the differentiation?

- The integral of the function
- The value of the function at x
- The average rate of the change between two points
- The slope of the tangent line at x

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The correct answer is:

**The slope of the tangent line at x**

\( f'(x) \) represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of the function at \( x \), which is the **slope of the tangent line** to the curve at that point.

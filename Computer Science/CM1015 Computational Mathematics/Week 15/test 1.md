##### 1. What is differentiation primarily the study of?

- Rates of change
- Discrete mathematics
- Algebraic equation
- Areas under curves

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

Differentiation is primarily the study of:

✅ **Rates of change**

It deals with how a function changes at any given point, which is essential in understanding slopes of curves, velocity, acceleration, and many other applications in calculus.

##### 2. Which of the following is a necessary for a function to be differentiable?

- The function must be discrete
- The function must be defined for all real numbers
- The function must be continuous
- The function must have a removable discontinuity

##### 3. What does the binomial help with in the context of differentiation?

- Solving linear equations
- Understanding limits of functions
- Calculating integrals of polynomials
- Proving differentiation for general polynomials

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The correct answer is:

✅ **Understanding limits of functions**

In differentiation, the **binomial theorem** is often used to expand expressions, particularly when finding limits, such as in the **definition of a derivative** using first principles. It helps simplify terms when evaluating limits, especially in problems involving small increments (e.g., using the binomial expansion to approximate \((x + h)^n\) when finding derivatives).

##### 4. Which of following rule is NOT used in differentiation?

- Product rule
- Pythagorean theorem
- Chain rule
- Quotient rule

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

The correct answer is:

❌ **Pythagorean theorem**

The **Pythagorean theorem** is a geometric principle related to right-angled triangles and is **not** used in differentiation.

The **Product rule**, **Chain rule**, and **Quotient rule** are all fundamental differentiation rules used to differentiate complex functions:

- **Product rule**: Used for differentiating the product of two functions.
- **Chain rule**: Used for differentiating composite functions.
- **Quotient rule**: Used for differentiating the quotient of two functions.

##### 5. In machine learning, which optimization algorithm is directly related to differentiation?

- Principal component analysis
- Support vector machines
- Gradient descent
- K-means clustering

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

The correct answer is:

✅ **Gradient descent**

**Gradient descent** is an optimization algorithm that relies on **differentiation** to minimize a function, often a loss function in machine learning. It uses the **gradient (derivative)** of the function to iteratively update model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent, helping to find the optimal solution.

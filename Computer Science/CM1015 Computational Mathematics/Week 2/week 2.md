#### Conversion of non-integer numbers between bases

The Main Concept

The system works just like base 10, but the place values after the point are fractions of the base, not 10.

- <strong>Decimal (Base 10)</strong>: `37.3` means (3 x 10<sup>1</sup>) + (7 x 10<sup>0</sup>) + (3 x 10<sup>-1</sup>). The column after the point is the <strong>tenths</strong> place.

- <strong>Binary (Base 2)</strong>: `101.11` means (1 x 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 x 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 x 2<sup>0</sup>) + (1 x 2<sup>-1</sup>) + (1 x 2<sup>-2</sup>). The columns after the point are the <strong>halves</strong> (1/2) and <strong>quarters (1/4)</strong> places.

For example the binary number `101.11` is converted to decimal as: 4 + 0 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 5.75

### Definition of a function and Cartesian coordinates

1. **What is a function in the context of relations?**

3. **What is an injective function?**

- A function that maps multiple elements in the domain to the same element in the range.
- A function where no two elements in the domain map to the same element in the range.
- A function where each element in the domain maps to exactly one element in the range
- A function where each element in the range maps to exactly one element in the domain

- Differentiate the function
- Switch the variables x and y
- Make y = f(x)

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

5. **In a Cartesian plane, what does the y-axis represents?**

- The origin
- The range
- The domain
- The function itself

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The range

</details>

6. **Determine if the following relation is a function.**

{ (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 5) }

- The relation is not a function
- The relation is a function

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The relation is not a function

</details>

7. **Find the inverse of the function f(x) = 2x + 3**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  <br>

To find the inverse of the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), follow these steps:

---

#### Steps:

1. **Rewrite \(f(x)\) as \(y\):**
   \[
   y = 2x + 3
   \]

2. **Switch \(x\) and \(y\):**
   This reflects the inverse relationship:
   \[
   x = 2y + 3
   \]

3. **Solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\):**
   \[
   x - 3 = 2y
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{x - 3}{2}
   \]

4. **Rewrite \(y\) as \(f^{-1}(x)\):**
   \[
   f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}
   \]

---

### Final Answer:

The inverse function is:
\[
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}
\]

This means that if you input a value into \(f^{-1}(x)\), you will retrieve the value that was originally input into \(f(x)\).

8. **Sketch the graph of y = -$\frac{1}{2}$x + 3 on the Cartesian plane**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The line has a slope of \(-\frac{1}{2}\), meaning it decreases as \(x\) increases, and the y-intercept is at \(y = 3\).

9. **Describe the interval notation for the set of all real numbers greater that -2 and less than or equal to 5**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The interval notation for the set of all real numbers greater than \(-2\) and less than or equal to \(5\) is:

\[
(-2, 5]
\]

Explanation:

- The parenthesis **\((-2\)** indicates that \(-2\) is **not included** in the interval (strictly greater than \(-2\)).
- The bracket **\[5\]** indicates that \(5\) is **included** in the interval (less than or equal to \(5\)).
- This interval includes all real numbers \(x\) such that:
\[
-2 < x \leq 5
\]

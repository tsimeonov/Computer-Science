7. **Find the inverse of the function f(x) = 2x + 3**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  <br>

To find the inverse of the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), follow these steps:

---

#### Steps:

1. **Rewrite \(f(x)\) as \(y\):**
   \[
   y = 2x + 3
   \]

2. **Switch \(x\) and \(y\):**
   This reflects the inverse relationship:
   \[
   x = 2y + 3
   \]

3. **Solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\):**
   \[
   x - 3 = 2y
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{x - 3}{2}
   \]

4. **Rewrite \(y\) as \(f^{-1}(x)\):**
   \[
   f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}
   \]

---

### Final Answer:

The inverse function is:
\[
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}
\]

This means that if you input a value into \(f^{-1}(x)\), you will retrieve the value that was originally input into \(f(x)\).

8. **Sketch the graph of y = -$\frac{1}{2}$x + 3 on the Cartesian plane**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The line has a slope of \(-\frac{1}{2}\), meaning it decreases as \(x\) increases, and the y-intercept is at \(y = 3\).

9. **Describe the interval notation for the set of all real numbers greater that -2 and less than or equal to 5**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The interval notation for the set of all real numbers greater than \(-2\) and less than or equal to \(5\) is:

\[
(-2, 5]
\]

Explanation:

- The parenthesis **\((-2\)** indicates that \(-2\) is **not included** in the interval (strictly greater than \(-2\)).
- The bracket **\[5\]** indicates that \(5\) is **included** in the interval (less than or equal to \(5\)).
- This interval includes all real numbers \(x\) such that:
\[
-2 < x \leq 5
\]

12. **For the function f(x) = x^2^, find the range when the domain is restricted to x ≥ 0
    **

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

To find the **range** of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) when the domain is restricted to \( x \geq 0 \):

---

Step 1: Analyze the Function

The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) maps the input \( x \) to the square of \( x \). For \( x \geq 0 \), the output will always be:

- Non-negative (\( f(x) \geq 0 \)).
- Continuous and increasing as \( x \) increases.

---

Step 2: Define the Range

Since \( x \geq 0 \):

- The smallest value of \( x \) is \( 0 \), and \( f(0) = 0^2 = 0 \).
- As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).

Thus, the range of \( f(x) = x^2 \) for \( x \geq 0 \) is:
\[
[0, \infty)
\]

---

Final Answer:

The range of \( f(x) = x^2 \) for \( x \geq 0 \) is:
\[
[0, \infty)
\]

13. **Evaluate whether the function f(x) = $\sqrt{x}$ is defined for x = -1**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) is **not defined** for \( x = -1 \) when considering the domain of real numbers (\( x \in \mathbb{R} \)).

---

Explanation:

1. **Square Root in Real Numbers**:

   - The square root function \( \sqrt{x} \) is defined in the real numbers only for \( x \geq 0 \). This is because the square root of a negative number does not exist in the set of real numbers; it belongs to the set of complex numbers.

2. **Substituting \( x = -1 \):**
   - \( f(-1) = \sqrt{-1} \)
   - In the real numbers, \( \sqrt{-1} \) is not defined. However, in the complex number system, \( \sqrt{-1} \) is denoted as \( i \), the imaginary unit.

---

Conclusion:
The function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) is **not defined for \( x = -1 \) in the domain of real numbers**. If complex numbers are considered, the value would be \( i \).

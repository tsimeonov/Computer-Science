7. **Find the inverse of the function f(x) = 2x + 3**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  <br>

To find the inverse of the function \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), follow these steps:

---

#### Steps:

1. **Rewrite \(f(x)\) as \(y\):**
   \[
   y = 2x + 3
   \]

2. **Switch \(x\) and \(y\):**
   This reflects the inverse relationship:
   \[
   x = 2y + 3
   \]

3. **Solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\):**
   \[
   x - 3 = 2y
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{x - 3}{2}
   \]

4. **Rewrite \(y\) as \(f^{-1}(x)\):**
   \[
   f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}
   \]

---

### Final Answer:

The inverse function is:
\[
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}
\]

This means that if you input a value into \(f^{-1}(x)\), you will retrieve the value that was originally input into \(f(x)\).

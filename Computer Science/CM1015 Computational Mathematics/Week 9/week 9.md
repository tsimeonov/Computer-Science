### Graphs of functions

**The x-y plane**

We introduce horizontal and vertical axes. The axes intersect at a point O called the origin.

**Inequalities and intervals**

We often need only part of the x axis when plotting graphs.
For example, we may be interested only in that part of the _x_ axis running from _x_ = 1 to _x_ = 3. Such parts of the _x_ axis are called **intervals**.

**Greater than and less than**

The symbols >, ≥, <, ≤ are known as **inequalities**

**Manipulation of inequalities**

Adding and subtracting the same quantity from both sides of an inequality leaves the inequality unchanged.
hence, for ant quantity _k_ if _x_ > _y_ then

x + k > y + k and x - k > y - k

Similarly, if x < y then

x + k < y + k and x - k < y - k

Multiplying and dividing an inequality needs greater care.
If an inequality is multiplied or divided by a **positive** quantity then the inequality remains unchanged.
If x > y and k is positive, then

kx > ky and $\frac{x}{k}$ > $\frac{y}{k}$

Similarly, if x < y and k is positive then

kx < ky and $\frac{x}{k}$ < $\frac{y}{k}$

### Graphs of functions

**The x-y plane**

We introduce horizontal and vertical axes. The axes intersect at a point O called the origin.

**17.2: Inequalities and intervals**

We often need only part of the x axis when plotting graphs.
For example, we may be interested only in that part of the _x_ axis running from _x_ = 1 to _x_ = 3. Such parts of the _x_ axis are called **intervals**.

**Greater than and less than**

The symbols >, ≥, <, ≤ are known as **inequalities**

**Manipulation of inequalities**

Adding and subtracting the same quantity from both sides of an inequality leaves the inequality unchanged.
hence, for ant quantity _k_ if _x_ > _y_ then

x + k > y + k and x - k > y - k

Similarly, if x < y then

x + k < y + k and x - k < y - k

Multiplying and dividing an inequality needs greater care.
If an inequality is multiplied or divided by a **positive** quantity then the inequality remains unchanged.
If x > y and k is positive, then

kx > ky and $\frac{x}{k}$ > $\frac{y}{k}$

Similarly, if x < y and k is positive then

kx < ky and $\frac{x}{k}$ < $\frac{y}{k}$

**Intervals**

We often need to represent intervals on the number line. To help us do this we introduce the set R. R is called the set of real numbers. We use to denote all numbers from minus infinity to plus infinity.
To show that a number _x_ is in this set, we write _x_ ∈ R, where ∈ means "belongs to".

There are three different kinds of intervals:

1. The closed interval, an interval that includes its end-points is called a **closed interval**. All the numbers from 1 to 3, including bot 1 and 3, comprise a closed interval, and this is denoted using square brackets, [1,3]

Hence the interval [1,3] can be expressed as

{x: x ∈ R, 1 ⩽ x ⩽ 3 }

2. The open interval - Any interval that does not include its end-points is called an open interval.

For example, all the numbers from 1 to 3, but excluding 1 and 3, comprise an open interval.
Such an interval is denoted using round brackets, (1,3). The interval may be written using set notation as

{x: x ∈ R, 1 < x < 3 }

3. The semi-open or semi-closed interval

An interval may be open at one end and closed at the other. Such an interval is called semi-open or some authors say semi-closed.
The interval (1,3] is a semi-open interval.
{x: x ∈ R, 1 < x ⩽ 3 }

**17.4 The domain an range of a function**

Independent variable:

- This is the input of the function
- It is the variable that you can control or choose values for

Dependent Variable:

- This is the output of the function
- it's value depends on the value of the independent variable

The set of values that we allow the independent variable to take is called the **domain** of the function. If the domain is not actually specified in any particular example, it is taken to be the largest set possible.
The set of values taken by the output is called the range of the **function**

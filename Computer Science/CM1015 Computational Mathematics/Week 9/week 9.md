### Graphs of functions

**The x-y plane**

We introduce horizontal and vertical axes. The axes intersect at a point O called the origin.

**Inequalities and intervals**

We often need only part of the x axis when plotting graphs.
For example, we may be interested only in that part of the _x_ axis running from _x_ = 1 to _x_ = 3. Such parts of the _x_ axis are called **intervals**.

### Higher order polynomials

1. **What is the general form of a quadratic equation?**

- y = x^3^ + bx + c
- y = ax + bx + c
- y = ax^2^ + bx + c
- y = mx + c

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

y = ax^2^ + bx + c

</details>

</br>

2. **In the equation y = mx + c, wht does "m" represents?**

- The y-intercept
- The slope of the line
- The vertex of the line
- The x-intercept

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The slope of the line

3. **What is the effect of the coefficient "a" in the quadratic equation y = ax^2^ + bx + c when "a" is negative?**

- The parabola opens downwards
- The vertex of the parabola moves upwards
- The parabola shifts to the right
- The parabola opens upwards

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The parabola opens downwards

4. **What happens to the graph of y = x^2^ when it's transformed to y = x^2^ + 3**

- The graph shifts 3 units down
- The graph shifts 3 units up
- The graph shifts 3 units to the right
- The graph remains unchanged

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The graph shifts 3 units up

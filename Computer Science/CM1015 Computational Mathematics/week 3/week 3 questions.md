  <summary>What is a sequence?</summary>

A sequence is a set of numbers written down in a specific order.
For example:
1,3,5,7,8 or -1,-2,-3,-4

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a term?</summary>

Each number in the sequence is called a `term` of the sequence.
The number of terms in the first sequence above is five, and the number of terms in the second is four.
1,3,5,7,8 or -1,-2,-3,-4

  <summary>What is the difference between infinite and finite sequence?</summary>

A finite sequence has a limited number of elements.
2,4,6,8,10 (This sequence ends at 10.)

An infinite sequence has an unlimited number of elements.

1,2,3,4,5,… (This sequence continues forever.)

  <summary>What Notation used for sequences?</summary>

We use a subscript notation to refer to different terms in a sequence. For example, suppose we denote (indicate) the sequence 1,3,5,7,9,11 by x. Then the first term can be called x~1~, the second term x~2~ and so on.
That is,
x~1~ = 1, x~2~ = 3, x~3~ = 5, x~4~ = 7, and so on

  <summary>Describe an arithmetic progression?</summary>

A particularly simple way of forming a sequence is to calculate each new term by `adding` a fixed amount to the previous term.
Such a sequence is called `arithmetic progression` or `arithmetic sequence`.
The fixed amount that is added each time is a constant called the `common difference`.

An arithmetic progression can be written

a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d ....

`a` is the `first term`, `d` is the `common difference`.

Study the following pattern:

- The firs term is `a`
- The second term is a + d
- The third term is a + 2d
- The forth term is a + 3d

And so on. This lead to the following formula for the `n`th term:

`a + (n-1)d`

  <summary>What is a geometric Progression?</summary>

Another simple way of forming a sequence is to calculate each new term by `multiplying` the previous term by a fixed amount.
Such a sequence is called a `geometric sequence` or `geometric progression`.
The fixed amount by which term is multiplied is called the `common ratio`

<h5 style="color:FireBrick;">Key points</h5>

A geometric progression can be written:
_a, ar, ar^2^, ar^3^_ .....
_a_ is the `first term`, _r_ is the `common ratio`

Study the following pattern:

- The first term is _a_
- The second term is _ar_
- The third term is _ar^2^_
- The fourth term is _ar^3^_

and so on. This leads us to the following formula for the n^th^ term:

The n^th^ term of a geometric progression is given by ar^n-1^

  <summary>What is an Infinite Geometric Progression</summary>

An **infinite geometric series** is the sum of all terms in an **infinite geometric sequence** — where each term is multiplied by the same fixed number (called the **common ratio**).

##### Example:

If the first term is \( 1 \) and the common ratio (\( r \)) is \( \frac{1}{2} \):
$$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + ...$$

This series goes on forever!

##### Key Points:

1. **Common Ratio** (\( r \)): The fixed number you multiply by to get each next term.
   - Example: \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).
2. **Convergence**: If \( |r| < 1 \) (|r| -> absolute value), the terms become smaller and smaller, and the series **converges** to a specific sum.
3. **Divergence**: If \( |r| \geq 1 \), the terms don't shrink, and the series grows without limit (**diverges**).

##### Formula for the Sum (if \( |r| < 1 \)):

\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\]
Where:

- \( S \) = sum of the series.
- \( a \) = first term.
- \( r \) = common ratio.

  <summary>What is a sigma notation?</summary>

Sigma notation $\sum_{}$, provides a concise and convenient way of writing long sums.
The sum 1+2+3 .... +10+11+12
can be written very concisely using the Greek letter $\sum_{}$ as

$$\sum_{k=1}^{k = 12} k$$

The $\sum_{}$ stands for sum, in this case the sum of all the values of `k` as `k` ranges through all whole numbers from 1 to 12.

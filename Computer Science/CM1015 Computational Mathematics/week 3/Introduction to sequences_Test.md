1. What is an arithmetic sequence?

- A sequence where each term is a product of the previous term
- A dequence where each term is the sum of all previous terms
- A sequence where each term is divided by a constant
- A sequence where each term is obtained by adding a constant to the previous term. `Correct`

2. Which term represents the common difference in an arithmetic sequence

- r
- d `correct`
- n
- a

3. What is the first term of an arithmetic sequence called?

- d
- a `correct`
- r
- n

4. How is hte nth term of an arithmetic sequence represented?

- a + nd
- a + (n-1)^d^ `correct`
- a / (n-1)
- a \* r ^(n-1)^

5. What is a geometric sequence

- A sequence where each term is divided by a constant
- A sequence where each term is added by a constant
- A sequence where each term is multiplied by a constant `correct`
- A sequence where each term is subtracteed by a constant

6. What does the common ratio in a geometric sequnce represent

- The product of terms
- The sum of terms
- The ratio between consecutive terms `correct`
- The difference between terms

7. How is the nth term of a geometric sequence represented?

- a \* (n-1)
- a + (n-1)d
- a / r^(n-1)^ `correct`
- a \* r^(n-1)^

8. What happens to a geometric sequence if the common ratio `r` is greater than 1?

- It remains constant
- It oscillates between values
- it diverges to infinity `diverges to infinity`
- It converges to a number

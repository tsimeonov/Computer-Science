### Lesson 2.2: Introduction to sequences and series

<h5>Introduction to sequences and series:</h5>

A sequence and a series are fundamental concepts in mathematics that deal with ordered lists of numbers and the sum of these numbers.

<h5>Geometric and arithmetic series</h5>

A `sequence` is an orderd list of numbers that follow a speciffic rule or pattern. Each number in a sequence is called a `term`

Types of sequences:

- Arithmetic sequence: Each term is obtained by adding a fixed number (common difference, _d_)

  - Example: 2,5,8,11, .... (where _d_ = 3)
  - General form: a~n~ = a~1~ + (n-1)\*d

- Geometric Sequence: Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed number (common ratio, _r_)

  - Example: 3,6,12,24, .... (where _r_ = 2)
  - General form: a~n~ = a~1~ \* r(^n-1^)

<h5>Convergent and divergent sequences</h5>

In the study of sequences, the term `convergent` and `divergent` describe the behaviour of a sequence as the number of terms goes to infinity.

`Convergent Sequence`

A sequence is called `convergent` if its terms get closer and closer to a particular value as the sequence preogresses.
This specific value is called the `limit` of the sequence.

a~n~ = $\frac{1}{n}$

when n = 1,2,3...

Explanation of convergence:

1. For n = 1: a~1~ = $\frac{1}{1}$ = 1
2. For n = 2: a~2~ = $\frac{1}{2}$ = 0.5
3. For n = 3: a~3~ = $\frac{1}{3}$ $\approx$ 0.333
4. For n = 4: a~4~ = $\frac{1}{4}$ = 0.25

As n gets larger, a~n~ gets closer and closer to 0.
So, we say that the limit of the sequence $\frac{1}{n}$ as n -> $\infty$ is 0

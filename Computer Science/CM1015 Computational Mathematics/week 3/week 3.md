### Lesson 2.2: Introduction to sequences and series

<h5>Introduction to sequences and series:</h5>

A sequence and a series are fundamental concepts in mathematics that deal with ordered lists of numbers and the sum of these numbers.

1. Sequence

A `sequence` is an orderd list of numbers that follow a speciffic rule or pattern. Each number in a sequence is called a `term`

Types of sequences:

- Arithmetic sequence: Each term is obtained by adding a fixed number (common difference, _d_)

  - Example: 2,5,8,11, .... (where _d_ = 3)
  - General form: a~n~ = a~1~ + (n-1).d

- Geometric Sequence: Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed number (common ratio, _r_)

  - Example: 3,6,12,24, .... (where _r_ = 2)
  - General form: a~n~ = a~1~ \* r(^n-1^)

2. Series

A `series` is the sum of the terms of a sequence. It can be thought of as a way to combine the values in a sequence into a single cumulative sum

- Arithmetic series: The sum of the terms in an arithmetic sequence
  - Example: Sum of 2,5,8,11, ...
  - Sum formula: S~n~ = n/2 \* (a~1~ + a~n~)

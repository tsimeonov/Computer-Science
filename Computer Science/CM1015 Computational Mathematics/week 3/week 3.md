### Lesson 2.2: Introduction to sequences and series

<h5>Introduction to sequences and series:</h5>

`Sequence`

A sequence is a set of numbers written down in a specific order.
For example:
1,3,5,7,8 or -1,-2,-3,-4

Each number in the sequence is called a `term` of the sequence.
The number of terms in the first sequence above is five, and the number of terms in the second is four.

Sometimes we use the symbol `'...'` to indicate that the sequence continues.

All of the sequences given above have a finite number of terms. They are known as `finite sequences`. Some sequences go no for ever, and these are called `infinite sequences`. To indicate that a sequence might go on for ever we can use the '...' notation. So when we write
1,3,5,7,9 ...
it can be assumed that this sequence continues indefinitely.

<h5>Notation used for sequences</h5>

We use a subscript notation to refer to different terms in a sequence. For example, suppose we denote (indicate) the sequence 1,3,5,7,9,11 by x. Then the first term can be called x~1~, the second term x~2~ and so on.
That is,
x~1~ = 1, x~2~ = 3, x~3~ = 5, x~4~ = 7, and so on

<h5>Arithmetic progressions</h5>

A particularly simple way of forming a sequence is to calculate each new term by `adding` a fixed amount to the previous term. For example, suppose the first term is 1 and we find the subsequent terms by repeatedly adding 6. We obtain
1,7,13,19 ....
Such a sequence is called `arithmetic progression` or `arithmetic sequence`.
The fixed amount that is added each time is a constant called the `common difference`.

An arithmetic progression can be written

a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d ....

a is the `first term`. d is the `common difference`.

Study the following pattern:

- The firs term is `a`
- The second term is a + d
- The third term is a + 2d
- The forth term is a + 3d

And so on. This lead to the folowing formula for the `n`th term:

`a + (n-1)d`

<h5>Geometric Progression</h5>

Another simple way of forming a sequence is to calculate each new term by `multiplying` the previous term by a fixed amount. For example, suppose the first term of a sequence is 2, and we find the second, third, and forth terms by repeatedly multiplying by 5. We obtain the sequence
2,10,50,250
Such a sequence is called a `geometric sequence` or `geometric progression`.
The fixed amount by which term is multiplied is called the `common ratio`

<h5 style="color:FireBrick;">Key points</h5>

A geometric progression can be written:
_a, ar, ar^2^, ar^3^_ .....
_a_ is the `first term`, _r_ is the `common ratio`

Study the following pattern:

- The first term is _a_
- The second term is _ar_
- The third term is _ar^2^_
- The fourth term is _ar^3^_

and so on. This leads us to the following formula for the n^th^ term:

The n^th^ term of a geometric progression is given by ar^n-1^

4. For n = 4: a~4~ = $\frac{1}{4}$ = 0.25

<h5>Infinite sequences</h5>

Some sequences continue indefinitely, and these are called `infinite sequences`

It can happen that as we move along the sequence the terms get closer and closer to a fixed value.
For example:
1, $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty}}$,$\frac{1}{3}$,$\frac{1}{4}$,$\frac{1}{5}$ ....
Notice that the terms are getting smaller and smaller. If we continue on for ever these terms approach the value 0.
The sequence can be written in the abbreviated form
x~k~ = $\frac{1}{k}$, for k = 1,2,3...
As `k` gets larger and larger, and approaches infinity, the terms of the sequence get closer and closer to zero.
We say that "$\frac{1}{k}$ tends ti zero as `k` tends to infinity", or alternatively "as `k` tends to infinity, the `limit` of the sequence is zero".
We write this concisely as:

$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty}}$ $\frac{1}{k}$ = 0

"lim" is an abbreviation for limit, so lim~k->âˆž~ means we must examine the behaviour of the sequence as `k` gets larger and larger. When a sequence possesses a limit it is said to `converge`.

However, not all sequences possess a limit.
Tje sequence defined by x~k~= 3k - 2, which is 1,4,7,10..., is one sucha example .
As `k` gets larger and larger so too do the terms of the sequence. This sequence is said to `diverge`.

<h5>Series and sigma notation</h5>

If the terms of a sequence are added the result is known as a series.
For example, if we add the terms of the sequence 1,2,3,4,5 we obtain the series 1+2+3+4+5
e

`Sigma notation`

Sigma notationm $\sum_{}$, provides a concise and convenient way of writting long sums.
The sum 1+2+3 .... +10+11+12
can be written very concisely using the Greek letter $\sum_{}$ as

$$\sum_{k=1}^{k = 12} k$$

The $\sum_{}$ stands for sum, in this case the sum of all the values of `k` as `k` ranges through all whole numbers from 1 to 12.

<h5>Arithmetic series</h5>

If the terms of an arithmetic sequence are added, the result is known as an `arithmetic series`. For example, the arithmetic progression with five terms having first term 4 and common difference 5 is 4,9,14,19,24.
It is easily verified that this has sum 70. If the series has a large number of terms then finding its sum by diretly adding all the terms will be laborious.
Fortunately there is a formula that enables us to find the sum of an arithmetic series.

<h5 style="color:FireBrick;">Key points</h5>

The sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series with first term `a` and common difference `d` is denoted by S~n~ and give by:

S~n~ = $\frac{n}{2}$ (2a + (n - 1) d)

<h5>Geometric series</h5>

If the terms of a geometric sequence are added, the result is known as a `geometric series`.
For example, the geometric progression with five terms having first term 2 and common ration 3 is 2,6,18,54,162.
If hte terms are added we obtain the geometric series 2+6+18+54+162

### Lesson 2.2: Introduction to sequences and series

<h5>Introduction to sequences and series:</h5>

A sequence and a series are fundamental concepts in mathematics that deal with ordered lists of numbers and the sum of these numbers.

1. Sequence

A `sequence` is an orderd list of numbers that follow a speciffic rule or pattern. Each number in a sequence is called a `term`

Types of sequences:

- Arithmetic sequence: Each term is obtained by adding a fixed number (common difference, _d_)
  - Example: 2,5,8,11, .... (where _d_ = 3)
  - General form: a~n~ = a~1~ + (n-1).d

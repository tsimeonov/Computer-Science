### Lesson 2.2: Introduction to sequences and series

<h5>Introduction to sequences and series:</h5>

`Sequence`

A sequence is a set of numbers written doen in a specific order.
For example:
1,3,5,7,8 or -1,-2,-3,-4

Each number in the sequence is called a `term` of the sequence.
The number of terms in the first sequence above is five, and the number of terms in the second is four.

Sometimes we use the symbol `'...'` to indicate that the sequence continues.

All of the sequences given above have a finite number of terms. They are known as `finite sequences`. Some sequences go no for ever, and these are called `infinite sequences`. To indicate that a sequence might go on for ever we can use the '...' notation. So when we write
1,3,5,7,9 ...
i can be assumed that this sequence continues indefinitely.

<h5>Notation used for sequences</h5>

We use a subscript notation to refer to different terms in a sequence. For example, suppose we denote (indicate) the sequence 1,3,5,7,9,11 by x. Then the first term can be called x~1~, the second term x~2~ and so on.
That is,
x~1~ = 1, x~2~ = 3, x~3~ = 5, x~4~ = 7, and so on

<h5>Arithmetic progressions</h5>

A particularly simple way of forming a sequence is to calculate each new term by `adding` a fixed amount to the previous term. For example, suppose the first term is 1 and we find the subsequent terms by repeatedly adding 6. We obtain
1,7,13,19 ....
Such a sequence is called `arithmetic progression` or `arithmetic sequence`.
The fixed amount that is added each time is a constant called the `common difference`.

An arithmetic progression can be written

a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d ....

a is the `first term`. d is the `common difference`.

Study the following pattern:

- The firs term is `a`
- The second term is a + d
- The third term is a + 2d
- The forth term is a + 3d

And so on. This lead to the folowing formula for the `n`th term:

`a + (n-1)d`

<h5>Geometric Progression</h5>

<h5>Geometric and arithmetic series</h5>

Explanation of convergence:

1. For n = 1: a~1~ = $\frac{1}{1}$ = 1
2. For n = 2: a~2~ = $\frac{1}{2}$ = 0.5
3. For n = 3: a~3~ = $\frac{1}{3}$ $\approx$ 0.333
4. For n = 4: a~4~ = $\frac{1}{4}$ = 0.25

<h5>Recursion</h5>

Recursion in mathematics refers to a process where a function, sequence, or definition is defined in terms of itself. It allows problems to be solved by breaking them into smaller instances of the same problem.

`Key Components of recurions`

1. Base case: The simplest instance of he problem, which can be solved directrly without further recursion

2. Recursive step: A rule or formula that relates the current problem to a smaller instance of the same problem

`Examples of Mathematical recursion`

1. Factorial function: The factorial of a number n(n!) is defined as:

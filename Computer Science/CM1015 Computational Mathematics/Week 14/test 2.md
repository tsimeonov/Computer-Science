We want to evaluate:

\[
7^{-4}.
\]

---

1. Convert the Negative Exponent to a Fraction

By the definition of negative exponents,

\[
7^{-4} = \frac{1}{7^4}.
\]

Since \(7^4 = 7 \times 7 \times 7 \times 7 = 2401\), we have

\[
7^{-4} = \frac{1}{2401}.
\]

---

2. Check the Provided Options

1) \(\tfrac{1}{7 \times 7^3}\)
   This equals \(\tfrac{1}{7^4} = \tfrac{1}{2401}\). This is the exact value of \(7^{-4}\).

2) \(\tfrac{1}{4^7}\)
   This is \(\tfrac{1}{16384}\), which is not \(\tfrac{1}{2401}\). Therefore, not correct.

3) \(0.0004164931\)
   Let’s see how \(\tfrac{1}{2401}\) compares numerically. Indeed,
   \[
   \frac{1}{2401} \approx 0.0004164931 \quad (\text{rounded}).
   \]
   This is the correct decimal approximation of \(7^{-4}\).

4) \(0.0000610352\)
   This is the decimal for \(\tfrac{1}{16384}\). Hence not correct for \(7^{-4}\).

---

3. Correct Representation

- The **exact value** of \(7^{-4}\) is \(\dfrac{1}{7^4} = \dfrac{1}{2401}\).
- The **decimal approximation** is approximately \(0.0004164931\).

In terms of the given options, both (1) and (3) represent the correct value of \(7^{-4}\). Specifically:

- Option **(1)** is the exact fractional form: \(\dfrac{1}{7^4}\).
- Option **(3)** is the correct numerical approximation to several decimal places.

---

Final Answer

\[
\boxed{7^{-4} \;=\; \frac{1}{2401} \;\approx\; 0.0004164931.}
\]

##### 2. The value of x, solve for the variable

3^x^ - 1 = 4

Select all the correct answers:

- x = 3
- x = ${\frac{log5}{log3}}$
- x = ${\frac{log3}{log5}}$
- x = ${\frac{1}{3}}$
- ≈ 1.46
- ≈ 0.68

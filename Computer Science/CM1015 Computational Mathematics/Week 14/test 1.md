#### Logarithmic functions

##### 1. What is the inverse function of the exponential function a^x^?

- e^x^
- log~a~(x)
- x^a^
- ${\frac{1}{a^x}}$

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

The exponential function \( a^x \) and the logarithmic function \( \log_a(x) \) are inverses of each other. This means that if:

\[
y = a^x,
\]

then the inverse is given by:

\[
x = \log_a(y).
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

- **log~a~(x)**

##### 2. Which property of logarithms is illustrated by the equation log~b~(M \* N) = log~b~(M) + log~b~(N)?

- Product rule
- Power rule
- Quotient rule
- Change of base formula

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

    The equation log~b~(M \* N) = log~b~(M) + log~b~(N) represents the Product Rule for logarithms

    Answer: Product rule

##### 3. For which value of the x does the logarithmic function log~b~(b^x^) = x hold true?

- 1
- b
- Any real number
- 0

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

The identity

\[
\log_b(b^x) = x
\]

holds for **any real value** of \( x \). This is a fundamental property of logarithms: applying the log base \( b \) to \( b^x \) simply returns \( x \).

**Answer: Any real number**

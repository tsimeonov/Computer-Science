#### Logarithmic functions

##### 1. What is the inverse function of the exponential function a^x^?

- e^x^
- log~a~(x)
- x^a^
- ${\frac{1}{a^x}}$

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

The exponential function \( a^x \) and the logarithmic function \( \log_a(x) \) are inverses of each other. This means that if:

\[
y = a^x,
\]

then the inverse is given by:

\[
x = \log_a(y).
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

- **log~a~(x)**

##### 2. Which property of logarithms is illustrated by the equation log~b~(M \* N) = log~b~(M) + log~b~(N)?

- Product rule
- Power rule
- Quotient rule
- Change of base formula

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

    The equation log~b~(M \* N) = log~b~(M) + log~b~(N) represents the Product Rule for logarithms

    Answer: Product rule

##### 3. For which value of the x does the logarithmic function log~b~(b^x^) = x hold true?

- 1
- b
- Any real number
- 0

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

The identity

\[
\log_b(b^x) = x
\]

holds for **any real value** of \( x \). This is a fundamental property of logarithms: applying the log base \( b \) to \( b^x \) simply returns \( x \).

**Answer: Any real number**

##### 4. What is the value of the log~2~(16)

- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

To find the value of \(\log_2(16)\), notice that \(16 = 2^4\). Therefore:

\[
\log_2(16) = 4.
\]

**Answer: 4**

##### 5. If log~a~(x) = 3, what is the value of x?

- a^3^
- a
- ${\frac{1}{a^3}}$
- 3

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

**Problem Statement:**
If \(\log_a(x) = 3\), find the value of \(x\).

---

Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Recall the definition of a logarithm:**
   By definition, \(\log_a(x)\) answers the question: "To what power must we raise \(a\) to get \(x\)?"
   Mathematically, if \(\log_a(x) = y\), then it means \(a^y = x\).

2. **Apply this definition to the given problem:**
   We have \(\log_a(x) = 3\). According to the definition above, this directly tells us:
   \[
   a^3 = x.
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the value of \(x\) is:
   \[
   \boxed{x = a^3}.
   \]

---

**Answer:** \( x = a^3 \)

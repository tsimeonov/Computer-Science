#### Logarithmic functions

1. **What is the inverse function of the exponential function a^x^?**

- e^x^
- log~a~(x)
- x^a^
- ${\frac{1}{a^x}}$

  <summary>Solution</summary>

  </br>

The exponential function \( a^x \) and the logarithmic function \( \log_a(x) \) are inverses of each other. This means that if:

\[
y = a^x,
\]

then the inverse is given by:

\[
x = \log_a(y).
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

- **log~a~(x)**

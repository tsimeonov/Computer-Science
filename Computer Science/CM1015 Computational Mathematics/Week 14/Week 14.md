### Chapter 20: The logarithmic function

#### Chapter 20.1: Introducing logarithms

Given an equation such as 125 = 5^3^, we call 5 the base and 3 the power or index. We can use **logarithms** to write the equation in another form. The logarithm form is

log~5~ 125 = 3

This is read as "logarithm to base 5 of 125 is 3".

In general if

y = a^x^

then

log~a~y = x

---

**Key point**

y = a^x^ and log~a~y = x are equivalent

"The logarithm to the base a of y is x, is equivalent to saying that y is a to the power x. The word logarithm is usually shortened to just log"

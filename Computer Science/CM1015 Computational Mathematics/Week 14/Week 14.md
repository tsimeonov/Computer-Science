#### Chapter 20.1: Introducing logarithms

Given an equation such as 125 = 5^3^, we call 5 the base and 3 the power or index. We can use **logarithms** to write the equation in another form. The logarithm form is

log~5~ 125 = 3

This is read as "logarithm to base 5 of 125 is 3".

In general if

y = a^x^

then

log~a~y = x

---

**Key point**

y = a^x^ and log~a~y = x are equivalent

"The logarithm to the base a of y is x, is equivalent to saying that y is a to the power x. The word logarithm is usually shortened to just log"

#### Chapter 20.2: Calculating logarithms to any base

Suppose that we wish to calculate logarithms to bases other than 10 or e. For example, in communication theory, logarithms to base 2 are commonly used. To calculate logarithms to base _a_ we use one of the following two formulae:

log~a~X = ${\frac{log_{10} X}{log_{10}a}}$

log~a~X = ${\frac{In X}{In a}}$

#### Chapter 20.3: Laws of Logarithms

- The **first law** of logarithms states

log A + log B = log AB

- The **second law** of logarithms states

log A - log B = log$({\frac{A}{B}})$

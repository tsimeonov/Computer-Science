### Sine and cosine rules

1. **What is the sine rule formula for a triangle?**

- $\frac{a}{sin A}$ = $\frac{b}{sin B}$ = $\frac{c}{sin C}$
- a^2^ = b^2^ + c^2^ - 2bc cos A
- sin A + sin B + sin C = 1
- sin A _ a = sin B _ b = sin C \* c

$\frac{a}{sin A}$ = $\frac{b}{sin B}$ = $\frac{c}{sin C}$

2. **When should you typically use the sine rule?**

- When you have two angles and one side
- When you have two sides and one angle
- When you have three sides and need to find an angle
- Both A nd B

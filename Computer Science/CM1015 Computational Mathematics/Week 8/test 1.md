### Sine and cosine rules

1. **What is the sine rule formula for a triangle?**

- $\frac{a}{sin A}$ = $\frac{b}{sin B}$ = $\frac{c}{sin C}$
- a^2^ = b^2^ + c^2^ - 2bc cos A
- sin A + sin B + sin C = 1
- sin A \* a = sin B \* b = sin C \* c

2. **When should you typically use the sine rule?**

- When you have two angles and one side
- When you have two sides and one angle
- When you have three sides and need to find an angle
- Both A nd B

3. **What is th formula for the cosine rule?**

- sin A \* a = sin B \* b = sin C \* c
- $\frac{a}{sin A}$ = $\frac{b}{sin B}$ = $\frac{c}{sin C}$
- a^2^ = b^2^ + c^2^ - 2bc cos A
- cos A + cos B + cos C = 1

5. **Given a triangle tithe angle A = 56deg, a = 76 and b = 35, find the angle B to one d.p**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

We can solve this using the **sine rule**:

\[
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B}
\]

Step 1: Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{76}{\sin 56^\circ} = \frac{35}{\sin B}
\]

Step 2: Solve for \(\sin B\):
\[
\sin B = \frac{35 \cdot \sin 56^\circ}{76}
\]

Step 3: Calculate the values:

- \(\sin 56^\circ \approx 0.829\)
  \[
  \sin B = \frac{35 \cdot 0.829}{76} = \frac{29.015}{76} \approx 0.3818
  \]

Step 4: Find \(B\):
\[
B = \arcsin(0.3818)
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
B \approx 22.5^\circ
\]

Final Answer:
\[
B \approx 22.5^\circ
\] (to one decimal place).

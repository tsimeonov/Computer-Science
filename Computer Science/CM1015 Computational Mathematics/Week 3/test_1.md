`10. Find the 10th term of an arithmetic sequence where the first term a is 5 and the common difference d is 3`

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  <br>

To find the 10th term of an arithmetic sequence, you use the general formula for the $n^{th}$ term:

$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$

Step-by-Step Calculation

1. Identify the given values:

   - First term ($a_1$): 5
   - Common difference ($d$): 3
   - Term number ($n$): 10

2. Substitute the values into the formula:

   - $a_{10} = 5 + (10 - 1) \times 3$

3. Simplify the expression:

   - $a_{10} = 5 + (9) \times 3$
   - $a_{10} = 5 + 27$

4. Final Result:

   - $a_{10} = 32$

   The 10th term of this sequence is 32.

`11. Determine the 5th term of a geometric sequence where the first term a is 2 and the common ratio r is 3.`

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

To find the 5th term of a geometric sequence, you use the general formula for the $n^{th}$ term:

$$a_n = a \cdot r^{(n - 1)}$$

Step-by-Step Calculation

1. Identify the given values:

- First term ($a$): 2
- Common ratio ($r$): 3
- Term number ($n$): 5

2. Substitute the values into the formula:

- $a_5 = 2 \cdot 3^{(5 - 1)}$

3. Simplify the exponent:

- $a_5 = 2 \cdot 3^4$

4. Calculate the power:

- $3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$

5. Final Multiplication:

- $a_5 = 2 \cdot 81 = 162$

The 5th term of this geometric sequence is 162.

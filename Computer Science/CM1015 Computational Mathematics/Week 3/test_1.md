`10. Find the 10th term of an arithmetic sequence where the first term a is 5 and the common difference d is 3`

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  <br>

To find the 10th term of an arithmetic sequence, you use the general formula for the $n^{th}$ term:

$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$

Step-by-Step Calculation

1. Identify the given values:

   - First term ($a_1$): 5
   - Common difference ($d$): 3
   - Term number ($n$): 10

2. Substitute the values into the formula:

   - $a_{10} = 5 + (10 - 1) \times 3$

3. Simplify the expression:

   - $a_{10} = 5 + (9) \times 3$
   - $a_{10} = 5 + 27$

4. Final Result:

   - $a_{10} = 32$

   The 10th term of this sequence is 32.

`11. Determine the 5th term of a geometric sequence where the first term a is 2 and the common ratio r is 3.`

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

To find the 5th term of a geometric sequence, you use the general formula for the $n^{th}$ term:

$$a_n = a \cdot r^{(n - 1)}$$

Step-by-Step Calculation

1. Identify the given values:

- First term ($a$): 2
- Common ratio ($r$): 3
- Term number ($n$): 5

2. Substitute the values into the formula:

- $a_5 = 2 \cdot 3^{(5 - 1)}$

3. Simplify the exponent:

- $a_5 = 2 \cdot 3^4$

4. Calculate the power:

- $3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$

5. Final Multiplication:

- $a_5 = 2 \cdot 81 = 162$

The 5th term of this geometric sequence is 162.

12. `If the 4th term of an arithmetic sequence is 20 and the common difference d is 5, find the first term a.`

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

To find the first term ($a_1$) of an arithmetic sequence when given a specific term and the common difference, you use the general term formula:

$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$

Step-by-Step Calculation

1.  Identify the given values:

    - The 4th term ($a_4$): 20

    - Common difference ($d$): 5

    - Term number ($n$): 4

2.  Substitute these values into the formula:

- $20 = a_1 + (4 - 1) \times 5$

3. Simplify the expression:

- $20 = a_1 + (3) \times 5$
- $20 = a_1 + 15$

4. Solve for $a_1$:

- $a_1 = 20 - 15$$a_1 = 5$

The first term ($a_1$) of the sequence is 5.

13. Calculate the sum of the first 6 terms of an arithmetic sequence with a = 2, d = 4

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

To calculate the sum of the first 6 terms ($S_6$) of an arithmetic sequence, you can use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms in conjunction with the formula for the $n^{th}$ term.

Step 1: Identify Given Values

- First term ($a_1$): 2
- Common difference ($d$): 4
- Number of terms ($n$): 6

Step 2: Find the 6th Term ($a_6$)

First, determine the value of the last term in the series using the general term formula $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$:

- $a_6 = 2 + (6 - 1) \times 4$
- $a_6 = 2 + (5 \times 4)$
- $a_6 = 2 + 20$
- $a_6 = 22$

Step 3: Calculate the Sum ($S_6$)

Now, use the sum formula $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$:

- $S_6 = \frac{6}{2}(2 + 22)$
- $S_6 = 3 \times (24)$$S_6 = 72$

Final Result:The sum of the first 6 terms of the sequence is 72.

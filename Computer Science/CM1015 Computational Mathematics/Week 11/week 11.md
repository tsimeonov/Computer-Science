#### 23.1: Extended definition of the trigonometric ratios

We used a right-angled triangle in order o define the three tri ratios.
The angle Î¸ is thus limited to a maximum value of 90deg. To give meaning to the trigonometric rations of angles greater
than 90deg we introduce an extended definition.

**Quadrants**

The _x_ and _y_ axes divide the plane into four quadrants.

**Projections**

We consider the _x_ and _y_ projections if the arm OC. These are illustrated in the figure. We label the _x_ projection OB and the _y_ projection OA. One or both of these projections can be negative, depending upon the position of the arm OC. However the length of the arm itself is always considered to be positive.

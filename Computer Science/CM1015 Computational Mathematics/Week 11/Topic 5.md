## Topic 5: Graph sketching and kinematics

### 1. Defining a Function

A function is a rule that takes an input (usually $x$) and assigns it to exactly one output (usually $y$ or $f(x)$).

- `Domain`: The set of all possible input values (what you are "allowed" to plug in).

- `Codomain`: The set of all potential output values.

- `Type`: This describes the relationship. For example, a linear function ($f(x) = mx + c$) creates a straight line, while a quadratic function ($f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$) creates a curve (parabola).

2. Cartesian Coordinates and Plotting

The `Cartesian plane `is a 2D grid defined by a horizontal axis ($x$) and a vertical axis ($y$).

- `Locating Points`: Every point is an ordered pair $(x, y)$. The first number tells you how far to move left/right; the second tells you how far to move up/down.

- `Plotting a Function`: To graph a function, you choose several $x$ values (the domain), calculate their corresponding $y$ values, plot those points, and connect them.

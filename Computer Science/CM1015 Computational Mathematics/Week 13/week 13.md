### 19: The Exponential function

##### 19.1: Exponential expressions

An expression of the form a^x^ is called an **exponential expression**.
The number a is called the **base** and x is the **power** or **index**.
For example, 4^x^ and 0.5^x^ are both exponential expressions. The first has base 4 and the second has base 0.5.

The letter **e** always denotes the constant 2.71828

The most common exponential expression is e^x^ where **e** is the exponential constant, 2.71828

##### 19.1: The exponential function and its graph

The **exponential function** has the form

y = e^x^

1. The exponential function is never negative
2. When x = 0, the function value is 1
3. As **x** increases, then e^x^ increases. This is known as **exponential growth**

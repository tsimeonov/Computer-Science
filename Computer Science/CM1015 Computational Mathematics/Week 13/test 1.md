### Exponential functions

**1. For the exponential function a^x^, if a = $\frac{1}{2}$, which of the following statements is true as _x_ approaches infinity?**

- The function oscillates between positive and negative values
- The function approaches infinity
- The function remains constant
- The function approaches zero

The given function is:

\[
f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x
\]

Step 1: Understand the behavior of the function

- The base \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) is between 0 and 1.
- Exponential functions with bases in the range \( 0 < a < 1 \) decrease as \( x \) increases.

Step 2: Analyze the limit as \( x \to \infty \)

- As \( x \) grows larger, the exponentiation \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x \) results in smaller and smaller values.
- Mathematically,

  \[
  \lim\_{x \to \infty} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x = 0.
  \]

Thus, the function approaches **zero**.

Step 3: Eliminate incorrect choices

- The function does **not** oscillate because it is always positive.
- The function does **not** approach infinity; instead, it decreases.
- The function does **not** remain constant since its value decreases continuously.

Correct Answer:
**The function approaches zero.**

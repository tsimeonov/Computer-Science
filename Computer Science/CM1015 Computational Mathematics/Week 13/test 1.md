### Exponential functions

**1. For the exponential function a^x^, if a = $\frac{1}{2}$, which of the following statements is true as _x_ approaches infinity?**

- The function oscillates between positive and negative values
- The function approaches infinity
- The function remains constant
- The function approaches zero

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The given function is:

\[
f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x
\]

Step 1: Understand the behavior of the function

- The base \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) is between 0 and 1.
- Exponential functions with bases in the range \( 0 < a < 1 \) decrease as \( x \) increases.

Step 2: Analyze the limit as \( x \to \infty \)

- As \( x \) grows larger, the exponentiation \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x \) results in smaller and smaller values.
- Mathematically,

  \[
  \lim\_{x \to \infty} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x = 0.
  \]

Thus, the function approaches **zero**.

Step 3: Eliminate incorrect choices

- The function does **not** oscillate because it is always positive.
- The function does **not** approach infinity; instead, it decreases.
- The function does **not** remain constant since its value decreases continuously.

Correct Answer:
**The function approaches zero.**

**2. Which property of exponential functions is illustrated by the equation a^n^ x a^m^ = a^n+m^**

- Division property
- Multiplication property
- Negative exponent property
- Power of a power property

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The given equation is:

\[
a^n \times a^m = a^{n+m}
\]

Step 1: Identify the property

- This equation states that when multiplying two exponential expressions with the **same base**, the exponents are **added**.
- This is a fundamental property of exponentiation.

Step 2: Match with the given answer choices

- **Division property**: This deals with the rule \(\frac{a^n}{a^m} = a^{n-m}\), which is not applicable here.
- **Multiplication property**: This correctly describes how exponents add when multiplying powers of the same base.
- **Negative exponent property**: This applies when exponents are negative, e.g., \( a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \), which is not relevant here.
- **Power of a power property**: This applies when an exponent is raised to another exponent, e.g., \( (a^n)^m = a^{n \cdot m} \), which is different from the given equation.

Correct Answer:
**Multiplication property**

**3. What is the result of $(16)^{\frac{3}{4}}$**

- 2
- 8
- 16
- 4

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

We need to evaluate:

\[
(16)^{\frac{3}{4}}
\]

Step 1: Express 16 as a Power of 2

\[
16 = 2^4
\]

Rewriting the expression:

\[
(2^4)^{\frac{3}{4}}
\]

Step 2: Use the Power of a Power Property

\[
(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}
\]

Applying this property:

\[
2^{4 \times \frac{3}{4}} = 2^{3}
\]

Step 3: Compute the Exponentiation

\[
2^3 = 8
\]

Correct Answer:

**8**

4. **If f~1~(x) = 2^x^ and f~2~(x) = $({\frac{1}{2}})^x$, what is the relationship between f~1~(x) and f~2~(x)**.

- f~1~(x) = f~2~(-x)
- f~1~(-x) = f~2~(-x)
- f~1~(x) = f~2~(x)
- f~1~(x) = f~2~(x)

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

We are given the functions:

\[
f_1(x) = 2^x
\]

\[
f_2(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x
\]

Step 1: Rewrite \( f_2(x) \)

We express \( f_2(x) \) using exponent properties:

\[
f_2(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x = 2^{-x}
\]

Step 2: Compare \( f_1(x) \) and \( f_2(x) \)

From the above expressions, we see:

\[
f_2(x) = 2^{-x}
\]

which means:

\[
f_1(-x) = 2^{-x} = f_2(x)
\]

or equivalently:

\[
f_1(x) = f_2(-x)
\]

Conclusion:

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\mathbf{f_1(x) = f_2(-x)}
\]

5. **Solve the x in the equation 3^2x^ = 27**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

We are given the equation:

\[
3^{2x} = 27
\]

Step 1: Express 27 as a Power of 3
Since \( 27 = 3^3 \), we rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^{2x} = 3^3
\]

Step 2: Equating the Exponents
Since the bases are the same, we set the exponents equal to each other:

\[
2x = 3
\]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

\[
x = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Final Answer:
\[
\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}
\]

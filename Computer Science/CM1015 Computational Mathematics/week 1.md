## Lesson 1.2: Introduction to number bases

<h5>Introduction to Topic 1</h5>

<h5>Introduction to number bases</h5>

- base 10 system, alsol known as the `decimal system` is the most commonly used number system in everyday life.

Example: 3457 in base 10

The number 3457 can be broken down as follows:
3457 = 3 x 10^3^ + 4 x 10^2^ + 5 x 10^1^ + 7 x 10^0^

Breaking it down step by step:

- 3 x 10^3^ = 3 x 1000 = 3000.
- 4 x 10^2^ = 4 x 100 = 400.
- 5 x 10^1^ = 5 x 10 = 50.
- 7 x 10^0^ = 7 x 1 = 7.

- base 2 system, also known as `binary`, is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1.

Example:

Let's take the binary number 1011 and convert it ti decimal (base 10)

- The first digit from the right (1) is in the 2^0^ place , so it represents 1 x 2^0^ = 1
- The second digit from the right (1) is in the 2^1^ place , so it represents 1 x 2^1^ = 2
- The third digit from the right (0) is in the 2^2^ place , so it represents 0 x 2^2^ = 0
- The forth digit from the right (1) is in the 2^3^ place , so it represents 1 x 2^3^ = 8

Now, sun the values:

8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11

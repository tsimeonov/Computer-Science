## Lesson 1.2: Introduction to number bases

<h5>Introduction to Topic 1</h5>

<h5>Introduction to number bases</h5>

- base 10 system, alsol known as the `decimal system` is the most commonly used number system in everyday life.

Example: 3457 in base 10

The number 3457 can be broken down as follows:
3457 = 3 x 10^3^ + 4 x 10^2^ + 5 x 10^1^ + 7 x 10^0^

Breaking it down step by step:

- 3 x 10^3^ = 3 x 1000 = 3000
- 4 x 10^2^ = 4 x 100 = 400
- 5 x 10^1^ = 5 x 10 = 50
- 7 x 10^0^ = 7 x 1 = 7

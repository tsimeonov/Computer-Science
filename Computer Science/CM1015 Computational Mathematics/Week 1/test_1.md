Introduction to number bases - conversion to decimal

1. `Why do humans typically use base 10?`

- Because we have 10 digits (fingers)

- Because we have five fingers on each hand

- Because we have 10 toes

- Because it is the most efficient base

2. `What does the number 327 represent in base 10?`

- 3 hundreds 2 tens and 7 ones

- 3 tens, 2 hundreds and 7 ones

- 3 ones, 2 tens and 7 hundreds

- 3 thousands, 2 hundreds and 7 tens

3. `What is the base used by computers to represent numbers?`

- Base 8

- Base 2

- Base 16

- Base 10

4. `Why do computers use base 2?`

- It is the most familiar to humans

- It was chosen arbitrarily

- It is the most efficient base for calculations

- It is simpler to implement with switches that have two states: on and off

5. `What is the general rule for any number to the power of 1?`

- It equals 0

- It equals the number itself

- It equals 1

- It equals the base

6. `How is the sound wave represented digitally on a computer?`

- Using base 8

- By sampling the wave and converting it into binary numbers

- Using base 10

- By recording it directly as a continuous signal

7. `In base 2, what does the binary number 1011 represent in decimal?`

First digit (leftmost): 1 is in the 8s place.

`1 \* 8 = 8`

Second digit: 0 is in the 4s place.

`0 \* 4 = 0`

Third digit: 1 is in the 2s place.

`1 \* 2 = 2`

Fourth digit (rightmost): 1 is in the 1s place.

`1 \* 1 = 1`

Finally, add the results: `8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11`

So, the binary number `1011` is equal to the decimal number 11.

| Division by 2 | Remainder |
| :-----------: | :-------: |
|    (57)/2     |     1     |
|    (28)/2     |     0     |
|    (14)/2     |     0     |
|     (7)/2     |     1     |
|     (3)/2     |     1     |
|     (1)/2     |     1     |

= (111001)<sup>2</sup>

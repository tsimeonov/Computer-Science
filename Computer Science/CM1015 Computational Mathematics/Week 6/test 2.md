3. **Find 219 + 122 (mod 42). As part of the calculation write 219 + 122 ≡ A + B ≡ C (mod 42), where A, B and C are integers between 0 and 41.**

Enter your answer as:
value of A, value of B, value of C
separated by commas and using no spaces.
For example, if A = 1, B = 2, C = 3 enter
1,2,3

  <summary>Solution</summary>

Step 1: Find A = 219 mod 42

219 / 42 = 5 remainder 9

So, A = 9

Step 2: Find B = 122 mod 42

122 / 42 = 2 remainder 38

So, B = 38

Step 3: Compute the sum A + B

A + B = 9 + 38 = 47

47 / 42 = 1 remainder 5

So, C = 5

### Modular arithmetic - summative quiz

1. **Find 11 in modulo 18.**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

11 / 18 = 0 remainder 11

Thus, 11 mod 18 = 11

2. **Perform the addition 222 + 321, give your answer in modulo 12**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

First perform the addition:

222 + 321 = 543

Divide 543 / 12 = 43 remainder 3

</details>

3. **Find 219 + 122 (mod 42). As part of the calculation write 219 + 122 ≡ A + B ≡ C (mod 42), where A, B and C are integers between 0 and 41.**

Enter your answer as:
value of A, value of B, value of C
separated by commas and using no spaces.
For example, if A = 1, B = 2, C = 3 enter
1,2,3

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

Step 1: Find A = 219 mod 42

219 / 42 = 5 remainder 9

So, A = 9

Step 2: Find B = 122 mod 42

122 / 42 = 2 remainder 38

So, B = 38

Step 3: Compute the sum A + B

A + B = 9 + 38 = 47

47 / 42 = 1 remainder 5

So, C = 5

5. **Calculate the multiplicative inverse of 1 in modulo 11**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The multiplicative inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that:

a \* x ≡ 1 (mod m)

For a = 1 and m = 11

1 \* x ≡ 1 (mod 11)

Clearly, x = 1 since multiplying 1 by itself gives 1:

1 \* 1 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 11)

Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 1 in modulo 11 is 1

7. **Find the smallest digit to be added to make 46 divisible by 7**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

To find the smallest digit that needs to be added to 46 to make it divisible by 7, we need to solve:

\[
(46 + x) \mod 7 = 0
\]

where \(x\) is a non-negative integer (digit between 0 and 9).

Step 1: Check the remainder of 46 modulo 7

First, calculate:

\[
46 \div 7 = 6 \text{ remainder } 4
\]

So, \(46 \mod 7 = 4\).

Step 2: Find the smallest \(x\)

We need to make the remainder zero. Since the current remainder is 4, the smallest \(x\) that would make the sum divisible by 7 is:

\[
7 - 4 = 3
\]

Step 3: Verify

Adding 3 to 46 gives:

\[
46 + 3 = 49
\]

And since:

\[
49 \div 7 = 7 \text{ remainder } 0
\]

49 is indeed divisible by 7.

Final Answer: The smallest digit to be added is **3**.

8. **Find 118 in modulo 218**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The modulo operation finds the remainder when dividing 118 by 218.
Since 118 is less than 218, the remainder is simply 118

9. **List the first 5 positive numbers that are congruent to 5 modulo 13**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

To find the first five positive numbers that are congruent to \(5 \mod 13\), we need numbers that satisfy:

\[
x \equiv 5 \pmod{13}
\]

This means the remainder when dividing \(x\) by 13 must be 5.

Step 1: Start with 5
The smallest positive number satisfying the condition is **5**, since:

\[
5 \mod 13 = 5
\]

Step 2: Generate the sequence
The next numbers will be generated by adding multiples of 13 to 5, since:

\[
5 + 13 \times n
\]

where \(n\) is a non-negative integer.

Step 3: List the first five terms

- \(5 + 13 \times 0 = 5\)
- \(5 + 13 \times 1 = 18\)
- \(5 + 13 \times 2 = 31\)
- \(5 + 13 \times 3 = 44\)
- \(5 + 13 \times 4 = 57\)

Step 4: Verify
Each number gives a remainder of 5 when divided by 13.

Final Answer:
**5, 18, 31, 44, 57**

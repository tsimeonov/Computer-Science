### Modular arithmetic - summative quiz

1. **Find 11 in modulo 18.**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

11 / 18 = 0 remainder 11

Thus, 11 mod 18 = 11

2. **Perform the addition 222 + 321, give your answer in modulo 12**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

First perform the addition:

222 + 321 = 543

Divide 543 / 12 = 43 remainder 3

3. **Find 219 + 122 (mod 42). As part of the calculation write 219 + 122 ≡ A + B ≡ C (mod 42), where A, B and C are integers between 0 and 41.**

Enter your answer as:
value of A, value of B, value of C
separated by commas and using no spaces.
For example, if A = 1, B = 2, C = 3 enter
1,2,3

  <summary>Solution</summary>

Step 1: Find A = 219 mod 42

219 / 42 = 5 remainder 9

So, A = 9

Step 2: Find B = 122 mod 42

122 / 42 = 2 remainder 38

So, B = 38

Step 3: Compute the sum A + B

A + B = 9 + 38 = 47

47 / 42 = 1 remainder 5

So, C = 5

5. **Calculate the multiplicative inverse of 1 in modulo 11**

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

The multiplicative inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that:

a \* x ≡ 1 (mod m)

For a = 1 and m = 11

1 \* x ≡ 1 (mod 11)

Clearly, x = 1 since multiplying 1 by itself gives 1:

1 \* 1 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 11)

Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 1 in modulo 11 is 1

### Topic 2: Sequences and series

1. The Notion of a Number Sequence and Convergence/Divergence

- Sequence: A sequence is an ordered list of numbers.
  - Example: The natural numbers are a sequence: $1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
- Convergence/Divergence: While not explicitly detailed in the sources, the concept relates to the behavior of the terms ($U_n$) as $n$ approaches infinity:

  - A sequence converges if its terms approach a single finite limit.
  - A sequence diverges if its terms do not approach a single finite limit (e.g., they grow infinitely large or oscillate).

2. Recursion and Induction in Defining Sequences

A. Recursion

A sequence can be defined recursively, where each term is defined by the preceding term(s).

This definition must be grounded by stating the initial term(s).

- General Recursive Formula for Sums ($S_n$): The sum of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is defined recursively as: $S_n = S_{n-1} + U_n$.

B. Arithmetic Sequences (Arithmetic Progressions - AP)

An AP is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms ($d$) is constant (the common difference).

- Sum Formula Proof: The formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an AP, $S_n$, can be proven using mathematical induction.

$$S_n = \frac{1}{2}n[2a + (n-1)d]$$

- $a$ is the first term.
- $d$ is the common difference.C.

Geometric Sequences (Geometric Progressions - GP)

A GP is a sequence where the ratio between consecutive terms ($r$) is constant (the common ratio).

- Sum Formula Proof: The formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a GP, $S_n$, can be proven using an algebraic method.

$$S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}, \quad r \neq 1$$$

- a$ is the first term.
- $r$ is the common ratio.

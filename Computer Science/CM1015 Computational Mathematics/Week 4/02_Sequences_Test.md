1. Write out the following explicitly and find the sum

- None of the options
- n - 3
- 3n + 1
- 3n - 1

4. Find the n^th^ term of the arithmetic sequence 14,18, 22, ...

- a~n~ = 14 + 4(n+1) = 4n + 18
- a~n~ = 14 x 4(n-1) = 56n - 56

8. Find S~1~, S~2~ and S~3~ and S~4~ for the following recurrence relation

9. Use mathematical induction to prove that
   p(n) = 1^2^ and 2^2^ and 3^2^ + ... + n^2^ = $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ for all positive integers `n`

Determine all the correct steps

- We assume that p(k + 1) is true
- We first show that p(1) is true
- We now assume that p(n+1) is true
- We now assume that p(k) is true
- We show that p(k+1) is true by adding (k+1)^2^ to both sides
- Simplify the terms and check if both sides are the same

10. The formula for the sum of `n` terms of a geometric progression is

- S~n~ = a~0~ + (n - 1) \* d
- S~n~ = $\frac{a(1 + r^n)}{(1 + r)}$
- S~n~ = $\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{(1 - r)}$
- None of the above

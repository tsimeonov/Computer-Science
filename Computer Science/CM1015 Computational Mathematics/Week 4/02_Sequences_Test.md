1. Write out the following explicitly and find the sum

$$\sum_{72}^{i=1} i$$

- 1 x 1 x 1.... x 1 = 1
- 1 + 72 = 73
- 1 + + 1 + 1 .... + 1 = 72
- None of the above

2. Write down the value of the next term in the sequence 1,1,2,3,5,8, ...

- 13
- 12
- 8
- None of the above

3. Find the n^th^ term of the arithmetic sequence 14,18, 22, ...

- a~n~ = 14 + 4(n+1) = 4n + 18
- a~n~ = 14 x 4(n-1) = 56n - 56
- a~n~ = 14 + 4(n-1) = 4n + 10
- None of the above

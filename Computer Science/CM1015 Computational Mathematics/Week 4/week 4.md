  <summary>1. Sequences vs. Series</summary>

  <br>

- A sequence is an ordered list of numbers (e.g., the natural numbers: $1, 2, 3, \ldots$).

- A series is the result of adding all the elements of a sequence together.

  <summary>2. Defining the Sum of a Series</summary>

  <br>

- The sum of a series can be defined recursively:The sum of the first $n$ terms ($S_n$) is equal to the sum of the first $n-1$ terms ($S_{n-1}$) plus the $n^{th}$ term ($U_n$).
- For the natural numbers sequence ($U_n = n$): $S_n = S_{n-1} + n$.
- The recursion must be grounded; for the natural numbers, $S_1 = 1$.

  <summary>3. Sigma Notation (∑)</summary>

  <br>

The Sigma notation ($\Sigma$) is introduced as a shorthand way to represent the sum of a series.

- The expression $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k$ represents the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers: $1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n-1) + n$.
- Here, $k$ is a dummy variable that counts from the lower limit (1) up to the upper limit ($n$).

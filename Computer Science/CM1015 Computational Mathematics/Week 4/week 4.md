### Lesson 2.3: Sequence and series

<h5>Learning Objectives</h5>

- Define series and calculate the sum of a given number of terms.
- Describe what a sequence is and how to either: write one down explicitly, use formulas or recursion to generate terms.
- Understand, identify and represent algebraically geometric and arithmetic sequences.
- Recognise the concept of convergence and divergence of a sequence and categorise sequences accordingly.
- Give examples of sequences in the context of computing.

- Commands are the smallest building blocks of your program.
- A program is a collectio of these individual commands put together in the right order to solve a problem, complete a task or maybe interact with the user.
- A programming language sets the vocabulary for the commands we can use in our programs. When we say we are codding in a specific language, we mean we are instructing the computer with the dictionary commands the language provides. The computer will interpret these commands and conver them into binary instructions that it's specific hardware understands.
- A library is a collection of code written by someone else that we can use in our programs, By using a library, we avoid something programmers like to call reinventing the wheel.

- Computer screens are made up of tiny dots
- Thse dots are called pixels
- The pixels are arranged into a grid

---

- In p5.js we create an area of pixels on a webpage we can draw to:
- This is called the canvas
- A canvas needs a width and height in pixels

```js
createCanvas(500, 400);

// 500 -> Width
// 400 -> Height
```

### 9.102 Testing for stability

##### 1. What does integration testing validate?

- The stability of the application within the operating system ?
- Unit of code
- The interface and the underlying code that controls it
- The interaction between units of code

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

**"The interaction between units of code"**

### **Explanation:**

**Integration testing** is a software testing phase that ensures different units/modules of an application work together correctly. It validates how individual components **interact** and communicate with each other after being combined.

**Why the other options are incorrect?**

- ❌ **"The stability of the application within the operating system"**
  - This is related to **system testing**, not integration testing.
- ❌ **"Unit of code"**
  - This is covered by **unit testing**, which tests isolated parts of the code.
- ❌ **"The interface and the underlying code that controls it"**

  - This is more related to **UI testing** or **functional testing**, not specifically integration testing.

  **Example of Integration Testing:**

- Testing an **API call** from a frontend UI to a backend service.
- Validating **database interactions** when multiple modules need to store or retrieve data.

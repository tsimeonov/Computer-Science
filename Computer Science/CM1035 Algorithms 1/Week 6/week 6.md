<summary>Introduction ot the Stack</summary>

  <br>

The Stack is a data structure similar to a Queue but differs in its access rules.

- `Access Point`: Unlike the Queue (which has accessible Head and Tail elements), the Stack has only one accessible element called the `Top of the Stack`.
- `access Rule (LIFO)`: A stack adheres to `Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)` access. Elements are added and removed only from the top.
- `Analogy`: A stack of plates. Plates are added or removed only from the top to ensure safety and quick access.
- `Purpose`: Stacks are excellent for quick, reliable loading and unloading of data in one specific location, often used for dynamic memory storage.

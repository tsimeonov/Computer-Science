<summary>1. Abstract data types vs Concrete Data Structures</summary>

A critical destinction in CS is made between the logical concept and the physical reality of data organization:

|  Concept   |                                   Abstract Data Type (ADT)                                   |                            Data Structure (Concrete)                             |
| :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Focus    |                               Behavior (What can the data do?)                               |               Implementation (How is the data stored and managed?)               |
| Definition | The kind of data, its possible values, and its allowed operations (e.g., PUSH, POP, LENGTH). | The physical organization of data in memory (e.g., contiguous blocks, pointers). |
|  Examples  |                           Boolean, Integer, Vector, Queue, Stack.                            |                         Array, Linked List, Hash Table.                          |

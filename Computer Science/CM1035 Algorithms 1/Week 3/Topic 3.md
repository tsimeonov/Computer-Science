  <summary>Basic elements of an abstract data structure (ADS)</summary>

An `Abstract Data Structure (ADS)` is a logical model for how data is organized and the operations that can be performed on it. It focuses on what the data structure does, not how it's implemented (which would be the concrete data structure).

The basic elements of any ADS are:

1. `Data`: The types of elements the structure holds (e.g., numbers, strings, objects).

2. `Structure (or Axioms)`: The rules governing the data's organization and relationships (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, or ordered indexing).

3. `Operations`: The set of allowed functions for accessing, adding, or removing data (e.g., PUSH, POP, HEAD, ENQUEUE, SELECT).

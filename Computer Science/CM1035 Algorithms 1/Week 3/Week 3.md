Discretisation and pseudocode

  <summary>Discretization</summary>

  <br>

First, it highlights that computers work in `discrete steps`, unlike some continuous real-workd process (like gradually turning up a thermostat) .Therefore, any algorithm for a computer must break down actions into distinct, step-bystep instructions. This process of convering continous actions into discrete ones is called `discretization`.

  <summary>What is Pseudocode?</summary>

  <br>

`Pseudocode` is a way to write down the steps of an algorithm using a mix of natural language and mathematical notation. It's designed to be easily readable by humans but structured wnough to resemble a computer program. It's more foramal than a flowchart but not tied to the struct syntax of any specific programming language.

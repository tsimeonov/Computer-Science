First, it highlights that computers work in `discrete steps`, unlike some continuous real-workd process (like gradually turning up a thermostat) .Therefore, any algorithm for a computer must break down actions into distinct, step-bystep instructions. This process of convering continous actions into discrete ones is called `discretization`.

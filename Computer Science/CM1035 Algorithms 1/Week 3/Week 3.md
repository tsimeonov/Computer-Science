## Lesson 2.1 Pseudocode

Discretisation and pseudocode

<details>
  <summary>Discretization</summary>

  <br>

First, it highlights that computers work in `discrete steps`, unlike some continuous real-workd process (like gradually turning up a thermostat) .Therefore, any algorithm for a computer must break down actions into distinct, step-bystep instructions. This process of convering continous actions into discrete ones is called `discretization`.

  <summary>What is Pseudocode?</summary>

  <br>

`Pseudocode` is a way to write down the steps of an algorithm using a mix of natural language and mathematical notation. It's designed to be easily readable by humans but structured wnough to resemble a computer program. It's more foramal than a flowchart but not tied to the struct syntax of any specific programming language.

  <summary>Pseudocode Notation</summary>

  <br>

Key elements used in pseudocode include:

- Assignment (`<-`): Used to give a variable a value (e.g. `x <- 2`). Variables can be created implicitly when assigned.
- Variable Names: Can be letters (`x`, `t`), or descriptive names (`temperature`, `DesiredTemperature`). Names cannot contain spaces (use `Desired_Temperature` or `DesiredTemperature` instead)
- Reading order: Instructions are read left-to-right, topto-bottom
- Self-Reference: Variables can be updated using own current value (`x <- x + 1`)
- Mathematical Operators: Standrad symbols like , +, -, \*, /
- Comparison Operators: Used to compare values

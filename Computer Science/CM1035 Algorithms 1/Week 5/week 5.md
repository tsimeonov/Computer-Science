  <summary>🏛️ The Vector Abstract Data Structure</summary>

  <br>

A vector is a `finite, fixed size, sequential` data collection

- `Finite`: It has a non-negative, integer number od elelements (which can be zero)
- `Sequential`: The elements are stored in a specific order, one after another in a line
- `Fixed-size`: The number of elements (its' lenght) is immutable, meaning it cannot be altered after the vector is created.

A key featire of a vector is that an elements' position or `index` acts as its address and can be used to access it directly.

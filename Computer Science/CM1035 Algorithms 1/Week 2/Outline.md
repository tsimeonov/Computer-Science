  <summary>💡 Problems and Algorithms</summary>

In computer science, a `problem` isn't a bug or a mistake. A problem is simply a task to be solved or a `question to be answered`. It's defined by:

- `An input`: The information you start with.

- `A desired output`: The information or result you want to get.

| Problem Example |                 Input                 |                Desired Output                 |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
|     Sorting     |     A list of numbers: [5, 1, 3]      |          The list sorted: [1, 3, 5]           |
|    Searching    | A list of names and one specific name | True if the name is in the list, False if not |
|     Baking      |              Ingredients              |                    A cake                     |

An `algorithm` is the `set of instructions`—the step-by-step recipe—that solves a problem. A good algorithm must be:

1. `Finite`: It must eventually end.

2. `Unambiguous`: Each step must be clear and have only one meaning.

3. `Correct`: It must successfully produce the desired output for the given input.

So, if the `problem` is "bake a cake," the algorithm is the recipe that tells you exactly how to mix the ingredients and how long to bake them.

Key concepts:
We will cover three key concepts:
pseudocode, iteration and conversion
from flowcharts to pseudocode.
Learning outcomes:
• Explain the necessity and concept
of pseudocode
• Describe the concept of iteration
and how it is represented in
pseudocode
• Convert flowchart (if possible) to
pseudocode

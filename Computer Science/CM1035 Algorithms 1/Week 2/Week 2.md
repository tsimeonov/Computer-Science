Flowcharts use standard `boxes and arrows` to represent the steps and flow of a process. Thy are usefull because they are abstract enough to describe many kinds of procedures, not just computer algorithms, and help in designing processes before implementing them.

- `Oval`: Represents the start or end of the process (terminal points).

- `Parallelogram`: Indicates an input (getting data) or output (displaying data) action.

- `Arrows`: Show the direction of flow between steps.

- `Diamond`: Represents a decision point, usually containing a yes/no question. Arrows leading out are labeled with the possible answers (e.g., "Yes," "No").

- `Rectangle`: Represents a basic action or processing step.

What is a problem?

In computing, a `problem` isn't a real--world issue but a well defined question with clear mathematical inputs and outputs. A vague question like "Should I take a holiday?" is not a computable problem. However, ita van be translated into one:

- `Input`: You have `x` total holiday days and have used `y` days.
- `Question`: How many holiday days do you have left?
- `Output`: The number `x-y`

A problem poses a precise question about a given input to generate a specific output.

What is an Algorithm?

An `algorithm` is simple, stepbystep set of instuctions that, when foloowed, correctly solves a problem. Think of it like a recipe. An algorith must have two key properties:

1. `Correctness`: It must always produce the right answer
2. `Basic instuctions`: It must be described using simple steps a computer can easily execute, like basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`. `/`) or simple logic (if-then statements).

What is a problem?

In computing, a `problem` isn't a real--world issue but a well defined question with clear mathematical inputs and outputs. A vague question like "Should I take a holiday?" is not a computable problem. However, ita van be translated into one:

- `Input`: You have `x` total holiday days and have used `y` days.
- `Question`: How many holiday days do you have left?
- `Output`: The number `x-y`

A problem poses a precise question about a given input to generate a specific output.

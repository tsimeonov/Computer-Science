`What is a problem?`

In computing, a `problem` isn't a rea--world issue but a well defined question with clear mathematical inputs and outputs. A vague question like "Should I take a holiday?" is not a computable problem. However, it can be translated into one:

- `Input`: You have `x` total holiday days and have used `y` days.
- `Question`: How many holiday days do you have left?
- `Output`: The number `x-y`

A problem poses a precise question about a given input to generate a specific output.

`What is an Algorithm?`

An `algorithm` is simple, step by step set of instuctions that, when folowed, correctly solves a problem. Think of it like a recipe. An algorith must have two key properties:

1. `Correctness`: It must always produce the right answer
2. `Basic instuctions`: It must be described using simple steps a computer can easily execute, like basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`. `/`) or simple logic (if-then statements).

`Historical Origins`

The idea of a step-bystep procedure predates computers by centuries.

- `Euclid's Algorithm`: Dataing back to around 300BC, this is one of the first knowm algorithms, designed to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers
- `Al-khwarizmi`: The moder word "algorithm" is derived from the Latinized name of the 9th-century Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, considered the father of algebra. His book provided the first systematic methods for solving kinear and qudratic equations.

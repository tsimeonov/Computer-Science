In this project, I developed a side-scrolling game using p5.js where the player controls a character moving through a world filled with trees, clouds, mountains, canyons, collectables, platforms, and enemies. The goal is to navigate through the world, avoid falling into canyons, defeat enemies, collect items, and reach the flagpole to complete the level.

One of the challenging parts was implementing character movement, especially handling jumping, falling, and plummeting into canyons. This required careful management of gravity, velocity, and collision detection with the platforms. It was tricky to ensure the character could smoothly transition from walking to jumping and falling while also interacting with various objects like platforms and enemies. Additionally, implementing the camera to follow the character's movement across the screen posed difficulties in maintaining the visual continuity of the game world.

I learned several skills throughout the project. Managing game physics, such as gravity and velocity, was a major focus. I also improved my understanding of object-oriented programming by creating reusable functions and classes, like for the enemies and platforms, which helped modularize the code and improve organization. The logic behind collision detection, both with platforms and enemies, was something I refined. I also honed my ability to manage the game state, such as handling player lives, game score, and checking when the game was over or the level was completed.

Overall, this project enhanced my problem-solving skills, deepened my knowledge of game physics and interaction, and allowed me to practice writing clean, maintainable code.

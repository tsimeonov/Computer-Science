- `Closed (proprietary) networks`: Use company-owned designs: (e.g Microsoft systems)

  <summary>Network Topologies</summary>

- `Bus topology`: All dedices share a single communication line
- `Star topology`: Devices connect to a central point (access point in WiFi)

</br>

</details>

</br>

<details>
  <summary>Protocols</summary>

- `Protocols` are rules for communication
- `CSMA/CD` (used in Ethernet): Devices listen to the bus and stop if collisions occur.
- `CSMA/CA` (used in wifi): Devices try to avoid collisions due to hidden termina; problems

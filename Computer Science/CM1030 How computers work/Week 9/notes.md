### Lesson 9.1 What is an operating system?

#### `Operating Systems`

The operating system (OS) is more than it's visible graphical user interface (GUI). It supports applications through core functions like device drivers, networking, and file access. It also includes utilities like a calculator or calendar. The OS's kernal is its core, managing hardware and critical functions behind the scenes.

#### `UNIX`

Unix is a foundational operating system developed in the 1970s, known for its portability due to being written in C. It inspired many modern systems. Linux, and BDS, used by Apple are major Unix-based systems, Today, most devices - from Android phones to iPhones and Macs run Unix-based Os's, exept Windows (Instead, it uses a unique kernel originally developed by Microsoftâ€”starting with Windows NT).

### Lesson 9.2 Operating system function

#### `File systems and memory management`

The operating system (OS) does far more than just provide a user interface. At its core lies the `kernel`, which offers essential services to applications. Key functions include.

- `Device driver management` - allowing apps to interact with hardware like printers using standrard interface.
- `File management` - organizing data into files and directories, including metadata like dates and ownership
- `Memory management` - allocating memory to applications and ensuring they don't interfere with each other. If memory runs low, it uses `virtual memory` by moving inactive data to the hard disk.

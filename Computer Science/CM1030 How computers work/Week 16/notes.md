Websites often use `HTML templates` for layout and a `database` for content, enabling many pages without separate files. A `Database Mangement Sysytem (DBMS)` stores data in a structured way and lets applications access it without knowing storage details.

The most common type is the `relational database`, which organizes data into `tables` (rows = tuples, colums = attributes), Related data is store in separate tables and linked via `IDs` (primary keys). Tablers can be connected using a `linked table`.

Data is retrieved and combines using operations like:

- `Select` - choose rows matching criteria
- `Project` - choose specific columns
- `Join` - merge data from multiple tables

Most systems use `SQL` to perform these operations.

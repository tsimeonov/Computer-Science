<details>
  <summary>Internet Application Protocols</summary>

Internet communication relies on multiple protocol layers.
The `application layer` focuses on what data is send an how it's used. Common Internet applications like `email`, `web browsing` and `voice over IP (VoIP)` use different protocols.

- `Email` uses `SMTP` (to send) , `POP/IMAP` (to fetch) and may also use `HTTP` for webmail.
- `VoIP` (e.g Skype) offten starts with a server to connect usesr, then switches to peer-to-peer connection
- `Web browsing` uses `HTTP/HTTPS`, where browsers (clients) request pages from servers using `URL's`
- URLs are translated to IP addresses by the `DNS` protocol, which uses `UDP` die to its simple request-reply format.

### Lesson 1.1 Abstraction

`Abstraction` is the process of `simplifying` a complex system by focusing in the important parts and ignoring irrelevant details.

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Analogy:
Car: You drive using the steering wheel, pedals, and gear â€” but you donâ€™t need to understand the engine mechanics.

Thatâ€™s abstraction!

A `notional machine` is a mental model or simplified conceptual understanding of how a computer or programming language executes code.

It's not a real machine it's an idea or visualization used to help people understand what' happening behind the scenes when code runs.

### Lesson 1.1 Abstraction

`Abstraction` is the process of `simplifying` a complex system by focusing in the important parts and ignoring irrelevant details.

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Analogy:
Car: You drive using the steering wheel, pedals, and gear â€” but you donâ€™t need to understand the engine mechanics.

Thatâ€™s abstraction!

#### **Notional Machines**

A `notional machine` is a mental model or simplified conceptual understanding of how a computer or programming language executes code.

It's not a real machine it's an idea or visualization used to help people understand what' happening behind the scenes when code runs.

#### **CPU and Memory**

Great topic! Letâ€™s break down **CPU** and **memory** â€” two core components of a computer â€” in a simple, clear way:

ðŸ§  **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

Think of the **CPU** as the **brain of the computer**.
It carries out instructions from programs â€” doing the actual thinking and decision-making.

#### âœ… What it does:

- **Fetches** instructions from memory
- **Decodes** them (figures out what to do)
- **Executes** them (performs calculations, moves data, etc.)

The CPU processes things like:

- Arithmetic (e.g., 2 + 2)
- Logic (e.g., if statements)
- Data movement (e.g., loading/saving from memory)

#### ðŸ’¾ **Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)**

Memory is like the **short-term memory** of a computer.
It stores:

- The program you're running
- Data being used right now

#### âœ… Key points:

- Itâ€™s **fast**, but **temporary** â€” it gets wiped when the computer turns off.
- The CPU constantly **reads from** and **writes to** memory while running programs.

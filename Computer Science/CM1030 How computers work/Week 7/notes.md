### Lesson 7.1 Computer architecture

#### CPU and memory

The `CPU` (central processing unit) is the brain of the computer that performs calculations and controls program execution.
It interacts with `main memory` via a `bus` and processes data store in fast, small `registers`. Larger, but still fast `cache memory` helps speed up access to frequently used data.

The CPU uses a `fetch-execute cycle`, reading instructions from memory using the `program counter` and `instruction register`.
These instructions act on data in registers using the `arithmetic logic unit (ALU)` and are guided by the control unit.
While CPU speed (in GHz) is important, `memeory speed`, `bus speed` and especially `cache size` often have a greater impact on overall performance.

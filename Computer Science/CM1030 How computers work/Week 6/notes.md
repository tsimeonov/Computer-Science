### Lesson 6.2 Compression

#### `Compression`

`Compression` reduces file sizes by removing redundancy in data.
There are two main types:

- `Lossless compression` retains all original information (e.g, using dictionaries or run-lenght eccoding)
- `Lossy compression` removes data (e.g in images or audio) that's usually unnoticeable, allowing for much greater size reduction.

Text an simple images compress well using basic techniques, but complex media like photos or videos require advanced algorithms.
However, `compression takes processing time`, so files often compressed for transfer and decompressed for use.

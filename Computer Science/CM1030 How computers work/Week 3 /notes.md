### Networks

#### What is a computer network ?

A computer network id a group of connected computers and other devices (like printers, routers or servers) that can communicate and share resources woth each other.

#### Types of computer networks

|Type| Description|Example|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|LAN|Local Area Network - small area like an office| School or home|
|WAN|Wide Area Network - Large, scale, global coverage| The interner|
|MAN|Metropolian Area Network - city wide network|City hospital systems|
|PAN|Personal Area Network - very small, personal use|Bluethooth between phone & tablet|

#### Key Components
- Router ‚Äì Connects different networks, like your home to the internet.
- Switch ‚Äì Connects devices in a local network and directs traffic.
- Server ‚Äì Provides data or services (like a website or file storage).
- Client ‚Äì A device that uses the network (like your laptop or phone).

### Security

A virus is a piece of software that copies itself from one computer to another without your knowledge, and is normally aimed at damaging your computer in some way. This could mean that it slows it down, or interferes in other ways with the working of your operating system, or it could perform specifically harmful actions like stealing your data, or hacking other machines on your network. 
One example of this is spyware, which records what you do on a computer and sends the information to a third party. 

Malicious software can also take the form of a Trojan horse which appears to be legitimate software, but performs harmful actions in secret. 
Another is that criminals can try and hack computer systems. That means getting access to a system that they would not normally have access to, so they can steal data. Hackers normally do this to web servers or other Internet servers that can contain lots of data rather than hacking anyone's individual computer. One way hackers do this is through a phishing attack. This is where people are fooled into giving away important data like passwords or bank details. This normally happens through a plausible looking email or website that looks like it's from your bank or similar site, but is actually controlled by criminals.

### Encryption

#### What is encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (called plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) so that only authorized users can access the original information.
It protects sensitive data during storage or transmission, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and security.

####  How It Works (Simplified)
1. Sender encrypts the data using an algorithm and a key.
2. The encrypted data is sent or stored.
3. Receiver decrypts it using the correct key.

####  Types of Encryption
1. Symmetric Encryption
- Same key is used for encryption and decryption.
- Fast, but key must be shared securely.
Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

2. Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.
- More secure for communication over untrusted networks.
Example: RSA

### The internet

#### üåê What is the Internet?

-  The internet is a network of networks that enables communication between computers across the globe.
-  Routers connect different networks and forward messages, allowing communication across boundaries

#### üì∂ Connecting to the Internet

- People usually connect through local networks (home, work, public places)
- These local networks connect to Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- ISPs connect to larger international networks called the Internet Backbone.

#### ‚úâÔ∏è How Messages Travel
- Messages do not travel directly from sender to receiver.
- They pass through multiple routers and networks, possibly spanning countries and continents.
- Messages may also pass through platforms like Coursera, adding more network hops.

üì¶ Protocols and Packets
- Communication uses multiple protocols at once (e.g., Wi-Fi, IP, TCP, HTTP).
- A protocol defines the rules for data exchange, like a virtual envelope.
- Messages are wrapped in multiple layers:
  - Application protocol (like email or web)
  - IP (Internet Protocol)
  - Network-specific protocols (like Wi-Fi)

### Lesson 5.0 Introduction

#### `The bit`

A `bit` is the most basic unit of digital information and can represent any two states - like 1 or 0, true or false.
Through simple, bits are powerful because they can represent many types of information depending on context.
While a single bit holds minimal data, combining `millions or billions of bits` allows computers to represnt complex things like images, sounds and documents.
The key idea is that `complex digital content is built from vast numbers of simple bits`

### Lesson 5.1 Data Storage

#### `Data storage`

Computers use two main types of storage: `main memory (RAM)` and `mass storage`

- `RAM` is fast and and temporary, used for active tasks but erased when power is off.
- `Mass storage` (like hard disks, SSDs) is slower but permanent and has larger capacity

`Microchips` use bits (1s and 0s) and logic gates (like flip-flops) to store and process data.

`SSDs` are faster than hard drives and common in newer devices.
`Cloud storage` offers remote, reliable storage but is slower due to Internet access.
`Cache memory` is very fast and stores data being used the right way.
Each storage has trade-offs between `speed, size, power use and cost` and understanding them is essentioal for designing and using modern computers.

### Lesson 5.2 Data representation

#### `Bytes and numbers`

`Bits` are the simplest unit of data, but to represent complex information, they are combined into larger units like `bytes` (8 bits).
A `byte` can represent 256 different values and is the standard unit for measurring memory.

Modern computers access data in `64-bit chunks` for efficiency, even for simple values like true/false. `Bit patterns` can represnt many things - letters, colors, numbers.
`Numbers` are especially useful because they can represnet almost everyting else (e.g images, text).

Binary numbers use base 2 and work similarly to decimal, enabling bits to represent both `whole and complex values`

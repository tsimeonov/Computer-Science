### Lesson 5.0 Introduction

#### `The bit`

A `bit` is the most basic unit of digital information and can represent any two states - like 1 or 0, true or false.
Through simple, bits are powerful because they can represent many types of information depending on context.
While a single bit holds minimal data, combining `millions or billions of bits` allows computers to represnt complex things like images, sounds and documents.
The key idea is that `complex digital content is built from vast numbers of simple bits`

Network security is crucial because data travels through potentially malicious computers. Protocols like **HTTPS** encrypt data at the application layer to protect it during transit. However, threats also come from **external attacks** like **hacking** and **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks, which can overload networks using normal-looking traffic. To defend against such threats, tools like **authentication**, **firewalls**, **blacklisting/whitelisting**, and **proxy servers** are used. These help filter and control traffic, though they can sometimes block legitimate users. As threats constantly evolve, staying updated is essential for network security and your role as a computer scientist.

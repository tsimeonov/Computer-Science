The history of computing is relatively recent.
The `first fully operational computer`, EDSAC was built by Maurice Wilkes at Cambridge.

Other pioneers include Alan Turing (who buily ACE and contributed to AI and cryptography) and John von Neumannm Eckers and Mauchhly in the US who laid tehnical foundtaions for modern computing.

Early computers had no operating systems - users scheduled time and programmed via `punch cards`. Later terminals allowed multiple users to share a mainframe in a system called `timesharing`. Today, we still use timesharing for web servers and manage multiple apps on personal devices.

Modern computers often have `multi-core processors`, allowing `load balancing` - efficiently assigning tasks to different CPU's. The evolution of `operating systems` has largely focused on managing programs and CPU usage efficiently.

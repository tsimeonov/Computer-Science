  <summary>Introduction to Topic 1</summary>

---

This topic introduces `number bases`, explaining why we use base 10 and why other bases, like base 2 (binary), are critical for understandsing how computers work.

The key points covered are:

- `Exploring different bases`: The course will focus in `binary (base 2)` and `hexadecimal (base 16)`, in addition to general principles for working in any base
- `Conversions & Arithmeric`: You will learn to convert numbers between bases and how to perform addition, substraction and multiplication in binary
- `Non-integer numbers`: The topic will explain how to represent numbers and decimal points (e.g 12.62) in binaty and other bases.
- `Number Types`: You will also lean the differennce between natural, integer, rational and irrational numbers, including a method for converting any recurring decimal into a fraction.

Convert numbers between these two systems:

- `Binaty to Decimal` - To convert a binary numbers like 1011<sub>2</sub>, you multiply each digit by its place value (which are powers of 2) and add them together.
  For example, 1011<sub>2</sub> = (1x8) + (0x4) + (1x2) +(1x1) = 11<sub>2</sub>

- `Decimal to binary` - To convert a deciaml number like 57<sub>10</sub>, you find the largest power of 2 that fits withhin the number and work you way down.
  For 57, you woudl need a 32, 16 , 8 and 1, resulting in the binary number 111001<sub>2</sub>

- `Exploring different bases`: The course will focus in `binary (base 2)` and `hexadecimal (base 16)`, in addition to general principles for working in any base
- `Conversions & Arithmeric`: You will learn to convert numbers between bases and how to perform addition, substraction and multiplication in binary

## Working with Reference Types

### Difference between Primitive Data Types and Reference Types

Primitive data types include:

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol (added in ECMAScript 6)
  The primitive data types are stored in the memory, and they have fixed size.

Reference data types:

- Ojects
- Arrays
- Dates
- Regular Expressions
- Custom objects
  Reference types are not stored directly in the memory, but instead, a reference to the value is stored in the memory (this is referred to as a pointer).
  
  #### Determining the type of a variable
  This can be done using the typeof operator. This is a unary operator; that is, it expects only one operand - namely, the value or varialbe the type of which is to be determend.

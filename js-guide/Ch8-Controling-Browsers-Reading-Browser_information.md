## 8.1 The Browser Object Model

The Browser Object Model (BOM) is part of the Document Object Model (DOM) that represents the browser's window and allows JS to interact with the browser itself.
While the DOM focuses on the web page's structure and content, the BOM focuses on the browser environment.

<img src="./img/size and position.png" width="500px" />

The `outerHeight` and `outerWidth` properties represent the height and width of the browser window, including all displayed browser bars. The `innerHeight` and `innerWidth` properties, on the othr hand, represent the height and width without the browser bars, but including scrollbars.

## 8.2.2 Changing the size and posotion of a Browser window

The `moveBy()` method can be used to move a browser window horizontally and vertically by a specified number of pixels, and the `moveTo()` method can be used to move the window to a specific position. Via the `resizeBy()` method, you can scale a browser window by a certain factor, and via the `resizeTo()` method you can scale to a certain size.

## 4.1 Objects

An object can be created with figure brackets `{}` with an optional list of properties. A property is a "key:value" pair, where `key` is a string (also called a "property name"), and `value` can be anything.

An empty object can be created using one of two syntaxes:

```js
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax
```

In modern JS, there are two types of numbers:

1. Regular numbers in JS are stored in 64-bit format IEEE-754, also as "double precision floating oint numbers".
2. Bigint numbers represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed because a regular integer number can't safelt exceed - 2<sup>53</sup> -1 or be less than - 2<sup>53</sup> -1.

### 5.2.1 More ways to write a number

Imagine we need to write 1 billion. The obvious way is:

```js
let billion = 1000000000;
```

We also can use underscore `_` as the separator:

```js
let billion = 1_000_000_000;
```

Here the underscore `_` plays the role of the "syntactic sugar", it makes the number more readable. The JS engine simply ingnores `_` between digits, so it's exactly the same one billion as above.

In JS, we can shorten a number by appending the letter `"e"` to it and specifying the zeroes count:

```js
let billion = 1e9; // 1 billion, literally: 1 and 9 zeroes
alert(7.3e9); // 7.3 billions
```

Now lets write something small. Say, 1 microsecond (1 milionth of a second).

Just like before, using `"e"` can help.

```js
let mcs = 1e-6; // five zeroes to the left from 1
```

### 5.2.2 Hex, binary and the octal numbers

Hexadecimal numbers are widely used in JS to represent colors, encode characters and for many other things. So naturally, there exists a shorter way to write them:
`0x` and then the number.

```js
alert(0xff); //255
alert(0xff); // 255 (the same, case doesn't matter)
```

### 5.2.3 toString(base)

The method `num.toString(base)` returns a string representation of `num` in the numeral system with the given `base`.

```js
let num = 255;
alert(num.toString(16)); // ff
alert(num.toString(2)); // 11111111
```

The `base` can vary from `2` to `36`. By default it's `10`.

### 5.2.4 Rounding

One of the most used operations when working with numbers is rounding.

There are several buit-in functions for rounding:

`Math.floor`

Rounds down: `3.1` becomes `3`, and `-1.1` becomes `-2`

`Math.ceil`

Rounds down: `3.1` becomes `4`, and `-1.1` becomes `-1`

`Math.round`

Rounds to the nearest integer: `3.1 ` becomes `3`, `3.6` becomes `4` the middle case: `3.5` rounds up to `4` too.

### 5.2.5 Imprecise calculations

Internally, a number is represented in 64-bit fortmat `IEEE-754`, so there are exactly 64 bits to store a number:
52 of them ar used to sotre the digits, 11 of them store the postion of th decimal oint, and 1 bit is for the sign.

```js
alert(1e500); // Infinity
```

### 5.2.6 Test: isFinite and isNaN

Remember these two special numeric values?

- `Infinity` and `-Infinity` is a special numeric value that is greater (less) than anything.
- `NaN` represent an error.

### 5.2.7 parseInt and parseFloat

```js
alert(parseInt("100px")); // 100
alert(parseFloat("12.5em")); // 12.5

alert(parseInt("12.3")); // 12, only the integer part is returned
alert(parseFloat("12.3.4")); // 12.3, the second point stops the reading
```

### 5.2.7 Other math functions

`Math.random()`

```js
alert(Math.random()); // 0.1234567894322
alert(Math.random()); // 0.5435252343232
alert(Math.random()); // ... (any random numbers)
```

`Math.max() and Math.min()`

```js
alert(Math.max(3, 5, -10, 0, 1)); // 5
alert(Math.min(1, 2)); // 1
```

### 5.2.7 Summary

To write numbers with many zeroes:

- Append `"e"` with the zeroes count to the number. Like `123e6` is the same as `123` with 6 zeroes `123000000`
- A negaive number after `e` causes the number to be divided by 1 with given zeroes.
  E.g. `123e-6` means `0.000123` (`123`` milionths).

For different numeral systems:

- Can write numbers in the hex (`0x`), octal (`0o`) and binary (`0b`) systems.
- `parseInt(str, base)` parses the string `str` into an integer in numeral system with given `base`, `2 <= base <= 36.`
- `num.toString(base)` converts a number to a string in the numeral system with the given `base`.

For regular numbers tests:

- `isNaN(value)` converts its argument to a number and then tests it for being `NaN`.
- `Number.isNaN(value)` checks whether its argument belongs to the `number` type, and if so, tests it for being `NaN`
- `isFinite(value)` converts its argument to a numer and then tests it for not being `NaN/Infinity/-Infinity`.

For converting values like `12pt` and `100px` to a number:

- Use `parseInt/parseFloat` for the "soft" conversion, which reads a number from a string and then returns the value they could read before the error.

In modern JS, there are two types of numbers:

1. Regular numbers in JS are stored in 64-bit format IEEE-754, also as "double precision floating oint numbers".
2. Bigint numbers represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed because a regular integer number can't safelt exceed - 2<sup>53</sup> -1 or be less than - 2<sup>53</sup> -1.

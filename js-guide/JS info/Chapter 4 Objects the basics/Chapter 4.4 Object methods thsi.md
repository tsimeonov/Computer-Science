## 4.4.1 Object methods, "this"

Objects ar eusually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};
```

And, in the real world, a user can act: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.

Actions are represented in JS by functions in properties.

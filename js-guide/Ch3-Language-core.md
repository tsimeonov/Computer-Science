<h5>3.1.1: Defining variables</h5>

To be able to use variables, you need to perform two steps.
First you need to create the variable. this process is generally referred to as `variable declarataion`.

```js
let firstName
let lastName
```

Second you need to assign an actual value to the variable. This is referred to as `value assignment` or `variable initialization`

```js
firstName = "Todor"
lastName = "Simeonov"
```

## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change thedocument structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

## DOM and JavaScript

The DOM is not part of JS language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites.
